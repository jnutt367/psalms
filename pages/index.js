            <p>( A Psalm of David )
Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.
    Not so the wicked!
    They are like chaff
    that the wind blows away.
    Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
    For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.</p>

            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>PSALM 2 &darr;</h2>
            <p>( A Psalm of David )
 Why do the nations conspire[a]
    and the peoples plot in vain?
 The kings of the earth rise up
    and the rulers band together
    against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
 “Let us break their chains
    and throw off their shackles.”

 The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
    the Lord scoffs at them.
 He rebukes them in his anger
    and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
 “I have installed my king
    on Zion, my holy mountain.”

 I will proclaim the Lord’s decree:

He said to me, “You are my son;
    today I have become your father.
 Ask me,
    and I will make the nations your inheritance,
    the ends of the earth your possession.
 You will break them with a rod of iron;
    you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”

 Therefore, you kings, be wise;
    be warned, you rulers of the earth.
 Serve the Lord with fear
    and celebrate his rule with trembling.
 Kiss his son, or he will be angry
    and your way will lead to your destruction,
for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
    Blessed are all who take refuge in him.            </p>

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
(when he fled from his son Absolam)
Lord, how many are my foes!
    How many rise up against me!
 Many are saying of me,
    “God will not deliver him.”

 But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
    my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
 I call out to the Lord,
    and he answers me from his holy mountain.

 I lie down and sleep;
    I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
 I will not fear though tens of thousands
    assail me on every side.

 Arise, Lord!
    Deliver me, my God!
Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
    break the teeth of the wicked.

 From the Lord comes deliverance.
    May your blessing be on your people.

                Answer me when I call to you,
    my righteous God.
Give me relief from my distress;
    have mercy on me and hear my prayer.

 How long will you people turn my glory into shame?
    How long will you love delusions and seek false gods?
 Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself;
    the Lord hears when I call to him.
 Tremble and do not sin;
    when you are on your beds,
    search your hearts and be silent.
 Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
    and trust in the Lord.

 Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?”
    Let the light of your face shine on us.
 Fill my heart with joy
    when their grain and new wine abound.

 In peace I will lie down and sleep,
    for you alone, Lord,
    make me dwell in safety.

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                For the director of music. For pipes. A psalm of David.
 Listen to my words, Lord,
    consider my lament.
 Hear my cry for help,
    my King and my God,
    for to you I pray.

 In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
    in the morning I lay my requests before you
    and wait expectantly.
 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness;
    with you, evil people are not welcome.
 The arrogant cannot stand
    in your presence.
You hate all who do wrong;
     you destroy those who tell lies.
The bloodthirsty and deceitful
    you, Lord, detest.
 But I, by your great love,
    can come into your house;
in reverence I bow down
    toward your holy temple.

 Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness
    because of my enemies—
    make your way straight before me.
 Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;
    their heart is filled with malice.
Their throat is an open grave;
    with their tongues they tell lies.
 Declare them guilty, O God!
    Let their intrigues be their downfall.
Banish them for their many sins,
    for they have rebelled against you.
 But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    let them ever sing for joy.
Spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may rejoice in you.

 Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
    you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

              For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to sheminith.
 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger
    or discipline me in your wrath.
 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint;
    heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
 My soul is in deep anguish.
    How long, Lord, how long?

 Turn, Lord, and deliver me;
    save me because of your unfailing love.
 Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
    Who praises you from the grave?

 I am worn out from my groaning.

All night long I flood my bed with weeping
    and drench my couch with tears.
    My eyes grow weak with sorrow;
    they fail because of all my foes.

 Away from me, all you who do evil,
    for the Lord has heard my weeping.
 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy;
    the Lord accepts my prayer.
 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish;
    they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.

            <p>( A shiggaion of David )
            which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.
 Lord my God, I take refuge in you;
    save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
 or they will tear me apart like a lion
    and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.

 Lord my God, if I have done this
    and there is guilt on my hands—
 if I have repaid my ally with evil
    or without cause have robbed my foe—
 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me;
    let him trample my life to the ground
    and make me sleep in the dust.[c]

 Arise, Lord, in your anger;
    rise up against the rage of my enemies.
    Awake, my God; decree justice.
 Let the assembled peoples gather around you,
    while you sit enthroned over them on high.
     Let the Lord judge the peoples.
Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness,
    according to my integrity, O Most High.
 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked
    and make the righteous secure—
you, the righteous God
    who probes minds and hearts.

 My shield is God Most High,
    who saves the upright in heart.
 God is a righteous judge,
    a God who displays his wrath every day.
 If he does not relent,
    he will sharpen his sword;
    he will bend and string his bow.
 He has prepared his deadly weapons;
    he makes ready his flaming arrows.

 Whoever is pregnant with evil
    conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
 Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out
    falls into the pit they have made.
 The trouble they cause recoils on them;
    their violence comes down on their own heads.

 I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness;
    I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.

 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!

You have set your glory
    in the heavens.
 Through the praise of children and infants
    you have established a stronghold against your enemies,
    to silence the foe and the avenger.
 When I consider your heavens,
    the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars,
    which you have set in place,
 what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
    human beings that you care for them?
 You have made them a little lower than the angels
    and crowned them with glory and honor.
 You made them rulers over the works of your hands;
    you put everything under their feet:
 all flocks and herds,
    and the animals of the wild,
 the birds in the sky,
    and the fish in the sea,
    all that swim the paths of the seas.

 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!"

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                  For the director of music. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A psalm of David.
 I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart;
    I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
    I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.

 My enemies turn back;
    they stumble and perish before you.
 For you have upheld my right and my cause,
    sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
    you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
 Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies,
    you have uprooted their cities;
    even the memory of them has perished.

 The Lord reigns forever;
    he has established his throne for judgment.
 He rules the world in righteousness
    and judges the peoples with equity.
 The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed,
    a stronghold in times of trouble.
  Those who know your name trust in you,
    for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.

 Sing the praises of the Lord, enthroned in Zion;
    proclaim among the nations what he has done.
 For he who avenges blood remembers;
    he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.

 Lord, see how my enemies persecute me!
    Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
 that I may declare your praises
    in the gates of Daughter Zion,
    and there rejoice in your salvation.

 The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug;
    their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
 The Lord is known by his acts of justice;
    the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.[c]
 The wicked go down to the realm of the dead,
    all the nations that forget God.
 But God will never forget the needy;
    the hope of the afflicted will never perish.

 Arise, Lord, do not let mortals triumph;
    let the nations be judged in your presence.
Strike them with terror, Lord;
    let the nations know they are only mortal.

            <p>
              Why, Lord, do you stand far off?
    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

 In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,
    who are caught in the schemes he devises.
 He boasts about the cravings of his heart;
    he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.
 In his pride the wicked man does not seek him;
    in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
 His ways are always prosperous;
    your laws are rejected by[b] him;
    he sneers at all his enemies.
 He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.”
    He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”

 His mouth is full of lies and threats;
    trouble and evil are under his tongue.
 He lies in wait near the villages;
    from ambush he murders the innocent.
His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
     like a lion in cover he lies in wait.
He lies in wait to catch the helpless;
    he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
 His victims are crushed, they collapse;
    they fall under his strength.
 He says to himself, “God will never notice;
    he covers his face and never sees.”

 Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God.
    Do not forget the helpless.
 Why does the wicked man revile God?
    Why does he say to himself,
    “He won’t call me to account”?
 But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted;
    you consider their grief and take it in hand.
The victims commit themselves to you;
    you are the helper of the fatherless.
 Break the arm of the wicked man;
    call the evildoer to account for his wickedness
    that would not otherwise be found out.

 The Lord is King for ever and ever;
    the nations will perish from his land.
 You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted;
    you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
 defending the fatherless and the oppressed,
    so that mere earthly mortals
    will never again strike terror.

For the director of music. Of David.
1 In the Lord I take refuge.
    How then can you say to me:
    “Flee like a bird to your mountain.
2 For look, the wicked bend their bows;
    they set their arrows against the strings
to shoot from the shadows

3 When the foundations are being destroyed,
    what can the righteous do?”

4 The Lord is in his holy temple;
    the Lord is on his heavenly throne.
He observes everyone on earth;
    his eyes examine them.
5 The Lord examines the righteous,
    but the wicked, those who love violence,
    he hates with a passion.
6 On the wicked he will rain
    fiery coals and burning sulfur;
    a scorching wind will be their lot.

7 For the Lord is righteous,
    he loves justice;

              For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
              1 Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;
                  those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
              2 Everyone lies to their neighbor;
                  they flatter with their lips
                  but harbor deception in their hearts.

              3 May the Lord silence all flattering lips
                  and every boastful tongue—
              4 those who say,
                  “By our tongues we will prevail;
                  our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”

              5 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
                  I will now arise,” says the Lord.
                  “I will protect them from those who malign them.”
              6 And the words of the Lord are flawless,
                  like silver purified in a crucible,
                  like gold refined seven times.

              7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe
                  and will protect us forever from the wicked,
              8 who freely strut about

            4 Do all these evildoers know nothing?

            They devour my people as though eating bread;
                they never call on the Lord.
            5 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread,
                for God is present in the company of the righteous.
            6 You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor,
                but the Lord is their refuge.

            7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
                When the Lord restores his people,
                let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

            <p>
       A psalm of David.
1 Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent?
    Who may live on your holy mountain?

2 The one whose walk is blameless,
    who does what is righteous,
    who speaks the truth from their heart;
3 whose tongue utters no slander,
    who does no wrong to a neighbor,
    and casts no slur on others;
4 who despises a vile person
    but honors those who fear the Lord;
who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
    and does not change their mind;
5 who lends money to the poor without interest;
    who does not accept a bribe against the innocent.

Whoever does these things
    will never be shaken.

            <p>
            A miktam of David.
1 Keep me safe, my God,
    for in you I take refuge.

2 I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord;
    apart from you I have no good thing.”
3 I say of the holy people who are in the land,
    “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.”
4 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.
    I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods
    or take up their names on my lips.

5 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup;
    you make my lot secure.
6 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
    surely I have a delightful inheritance.
7 I will praise the Lord, who counsels me;
    even at night my heart instructs me.
8 I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
    With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

9 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
    my body also will rest secure,
10 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
    nor will you let your faithful one see decay.
11 You make known to me the path of life;
    you will fill me with joy in your presence,
    with eternal pleasures at your right hand.              </p>

        PSALM 17</h2>
            <p>
                              A prayer of David.
                  1 Hear me, Lord, my plea is just;
                      listen to my cry.
                  Hear my prayer—
                      it does not rise from deceitful lips.
                  2 Let my vindication come from you;
                      may your eyes see what is right.

                  3 Though you probe my heart,
                      though you examine me at night and test me,
                  you will find that I have planned no evil;
                      my mouth has not transgressed.
                  4 Though people tried to bribe me,
                      I have kept myself from the ways of the violent
                      through what your lips have commanded.
                  5 My steps have held to your paths;
                      my feet have not stumbled.

                  6 I call on you, my God, for you will answer me;
                      turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.
                  7 Show me the wonders of your great love,
                      you who save by your right hand
                      those who take refuge in you from their foes.
                  8 Keep me as the apple of your eye;
                      hide me in the shadow of your wings
                  9 from the wicked who are out to destroy me,
                      from my mortal enemies who surround me.

                  10 They close up their callous hearts,
                      and their mouths speak with arrogance.
                  11 They have tracked me down, they now surround me,
                      with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.
                  12 They are like a lion hungry for prey,
                      like a fierce lion crouching in cover.

                  13 Rise up, Lord, confront them, bring them down;
                      with your sword rescue me from the wicked.
                  14 By your hand save me from such people, Lord,
                      from those of this world whose reward is in this life.
                  May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies;
                      may their children gorge themselves on it,
                      and may there be leftovers for their little ones.

                  15 As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face;
                      when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.

        PSALM 18</h2>
            <p>
              For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord. He sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
1 I love you, Lord, my strength.

2 The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;
    my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,
    my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

3 I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
    and I have been saved from my enemies.
4 The cords of death entangled me;
    the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
5 The cords of the grave coiled around me;
    the snares of death confronted me.

6 In my distress I called to the Lord;
    I cried to my God for help.
From his temple he heard my voice;
    my cry came before him, into his ears.
7 The earth trembled and quaked,
    and the foundations of the mountains shook;
    they trembled because he was angry.
8 Smoke rose from his nostrils;
    consuming fire came from his mouth,
    burning coals blazed out of it.
9 He parted the heavens and came down;
    dark clouds were under his feet.
10 He mounted the cherubim and flew;
    he soared on the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—
    the dark rain clouds of the sky.
12 Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,
    with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
13 The Lord thundered from heaven;
    the voice of the Most High resounded.
14 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,
    with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
15 The valleys of the sea were exposed
    and the foundations of the earth laid bare
at your rebuke, Lord,
    at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
    he drew me out of deep waters.
17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
    from my foes, who were too strong for me.
18 They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
    but the Lord was my support.
19 He brought me out into a spacious place;
    he rescued me because he delighted in me.

20 The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;
    according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord;
    I am not guilty of turning from my God.
22 All his laws are before me;
    I have not turned away from his decrees.
23 I have been blameless before him
    and have kept myself from sin.
24 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
    according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.

25 To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
    to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
26 to the pure you show yourself pure,
    but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
27 You save the humble
    but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
28 You, Lord, keep my lamp burning;
    my God turns my darkness into light.
29 With your help I can advance against a troop[e];
    with my God I can scale a wall.

30 As for God, his way is perfect:
    The Lord’s word is flawless;
    he shields all who take refuge in him.
31 For who is God besides the Lord?
    And who is the Rock except our God?
32 It is God who arms me with strength
    and keeps my way secure.
33 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;
    he causes me to stand on the heights.
34 He trains my hands for battle;
    my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
35 You make your saving help my shield,
    and your right hand sustains me;
    your help has made me great.
36 You provide a broad path for my feet,
    so that my ankles do not give way.

37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
    I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
38 I crushed them so that they could not rise;
    they fell beneath my feet.
39 You armed me with strength for battle;
    you humbled my adversaries before me.
40 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
    and I destroyed my foes.
41 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
    to the Lord, but he did not answer.
42 I beat them as fine as windblown dust;
    I trampled them like mud in the streets.
43 You have delivered me from the attacks of the people;
    you have made me the head of nations.
People I did not know now serve me,
44     foreigners cower before me;
    as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
45 They all lose heart;
    they come trembling from their strongholds.

46 The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!
    Exalted be God my Savior!
47 He is the God who avenges me,
    who subdues nations under me,
48     who saves me from my enemies.
You exalted me above my foes;
    from a violent man you rescued me.
49 Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
    I will sing the praises of your name.

50 He gives his king great victories;
    he shows unfailing love to his anointed,
    to David and to his descendants forever.

      PSALM 19</h2>
              <p>
              For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                1 The heavens declare the glory of God;
                    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
                2 Day after day they pour forth speech;
                    night after night they reveal knowledge.
                3 They have no speech, they use no words;
                    no sound is heard from them.
                4 Yet their voice[b] goes out into all the earth,
                    their words to the ends of the world.
                In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
                5     It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
                    like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
                6 It rises at one end of the heavens
                    and makes its circuit to the other;
                    nothing is deprived of its warmth.

                7 The law of the Lord is perfect,
                    refreshing the soul.
                The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,
                    making wise the simple.
                8 The precepts of the Lord are right,
                    giving joy to the heart.
                The commands of the Lord are radiant,
                    giving light to the eyes.
                9 The fear of the Lord is pure,
                    enduring forever.
                The decrees of the Lord are firm,
                    and all of them are righteous.

                10 They are more precious than gold,
                    than much pure gold;
                they are sweeter than honey,
                    than honey from the honeycomb.
                11 By them your servant is warned;
                    in keeping them there is great reward.
                12 But who can discern their own errors?
                    Forgive my hidden faults.
                13 Keep your servant also from willful sins;
                    may they not rule over me.
                Then I will be blameless,
                    innocent of great transgression.

                14 May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart
                    be pleasing in your sight,
                    Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

                  For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                    1 May the Lord answer you when you are in distress;
                        may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
                    2 May he send you help from the sanctuary
                        and grant you support from Zion.
                    3 May he remember all your sacrifices
                        and accept your burnt offerings.[b]
                    4 May he give you the desire of your heart
                        and make all your plans succeed.
                    5 May we shout for joy over your victory

                    May the Lord grant all your requests.

                    6 Now this I know:
                        The Lord gives victory to his anointed.
                    He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary
                        with the victorious power of his right hand.
                    7 Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
                        but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
                    8 They are brought to their knees and fall,
                        but we rise up and stand firm.
                    9 Lord, give victory to the king!

                      How great is his joy in the victories you give!

                  2 You have granted him his heart’s desire
                      and have not withheld the request of his lips.[b]
                  3 You came to greet him with rich blessings
                      and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
                  4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—
                      length of days, for ever and ever.
                  5 Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;
                      you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
                  6 Surely you have granted him unending blessings
                      and made him glad with the joy of your presence.

                      through the unfailing love of the Most High

                  he will not be shaken.

                  8 Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;
                      your right hand will seize your foes.
                  9 When you appear for battle,
                      you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.
                  The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,
                      and his fire will consume them.
                  10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
                      their posterity from mankind.
                  11 Though they plot evil against you
                      and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
                  12 You will make them turn their backs
                      when you aim at them with drawn bow.

                  13 Be exalted in your strength, Lord;

                                              For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.
                              1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
                                  Why are you so far from saving me,
                                  so far from my cries of anguish?
                              2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
                                  by night, but I find no rest.[b]

                              3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
                                  you are the one Israel praises.[c]
                              4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
                                  they trusted and you delivered them.
                              5 To you they cried out and were saved;
                                  in you they trusted and were not put to shame.

                              6 But I am a worm and not a man,
                                  scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
                              7 All who see me mock me;
                                  they hurl insults, shaking their heads.

                                  “let the Lord rescue him.
                              Let him deliver him,
                                  since he delights in him.”

                              9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;
                                  you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
                              10 From birth I was cast on you;
                                  from my mother’s womb you have been my God.

                              11 Do not be far from me,
                                  for trouble is near
                                  and there is no one to help.

                              12 Many bulls surround me;
                                  strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
                              13 Roaring lions that tear their prey
                                  open their mouths wide against me.
                              14 I am poured out like water,
                                  and all my bones are out of joint.
                              My heart has turned to wax;
                                  it has melted within me.
                              15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,
                                  and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;
                                  you lay me in the dust of death.

                              16 Dogs surround me,
                                  a pack of villains encircles me;
                                  they pierce[e] my hands and my feet.
                              17 All my bones are on display;
                                  people stare and gloat over me.
                              18 They divide my clothes among them
                                  and cast lots for my garment.

                              19 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
                                  You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
                              20 Deliver me from the sword,
                                  my precious life from the power of the dogs.
                              21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
                                  save me from the horns of the wild oxen.

                              22 I will declare your name to my people;
                                  in the assembly I will praise you.
                              23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!
                                  All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
                                  Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
                              24 For he has not despised or scorned
                                  the suffering of the afflicted one;
                              he has not hidden his face from him
                                  but has listened to his cry for help.

                              25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
                                  before those who fear you[f] I will fulfill my vows.
                              26 The poor will eat and be satisfied;
                                  those who seek the Lord will praise him—
                                  may your hearts live forever!

                              27 All the ends of the earth
                                  will remember and turn to the Lord,
                              and all the families of the nations
                                  will bow down before him,
                              28 for dominion belongs to the Lord
                                  and he rules over the nations.

                              29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
                                  all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
                                  those who cannot keep themselves alive.
                              30 Posterity will serve him;
                                  future generations will be told about the Lord.
                              31 They will proclaim his righteousness,
                                  declaring to a people yet unborn:
                                  He has done it!

                            A psalm of David.
                                    1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
                                    2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,
                                    he leads me beside quiet waters,
                                    3     he refreshes my soul.
                                    He guides me along the right paths
                                        for his name’s sake.
                                    4 Even though I walk
                                        through the darkest valley,[a]
                                    I will fear no evil,
                                        for you are with me;
                                    your rod and your staff,
                                        they comfort me.

                                    5 You prepare a table before me
                                        in the presence of my enemies.
                                    You anoint my head with oil;
                                        my cup overflows.
                                    6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me
                                        all the days of my life,
                                    and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
                                        forever.
