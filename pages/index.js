            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                          Blessed is the one
                              who does not walk in step with the wicked
                          or stand in the way that sinners take
                              or sit in the company of mockers,
                           but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
                              and who meditates on his law day and night.
                           That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
                              which yields its fruit in season
                          and whose leaf does not wither—
                              whatever they do prospers.
                              Not so the wicked!
                              They are like chaff
                              that the wind blows away.
                              Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
                              nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
                              For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
                              but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.

                  <p>
                                        ( A Psalm of David )
                           Why do the nations conspire[a]
                              and the peoples plot in vain?
                           The kings of the earth rise up
                              and the rulers band together
                              against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
                           “Let us break their chains
                              and throw off their shackles.”

                           The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
                              the Lord scoffs at them.
                           He rebukes them in his anger
                              and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
                           “I have installed my king
                              on Zion, my holy mountain.”

                           I will proclaim the Lord’s decree:

                          He said to me, “You are my son;
                              today I have become your father.
                           Ask me,
                              and I will make the nations your inheritance,
                              the ends of the earth your possession.
                           You will break them with a rod of iron;
                              you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”

                           Therefore, you kings, be wise;
                              be warned, you rulers of the earth.
                           Serve the Lord with fear
                              and celebrate his rule with trembling.
                           Kiss his son, or he will be angry
                              and your way will lead to your destruction,
                          for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
                              Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

                            (when he fled from his son Absolam)
                            Lord, how many are my foes!
                                How many rise up against me!
                             Many are saying of me,
                                “God will not deliver him.”

                             But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
                                my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
                             I call out to the Lord,
                                and he answers me from his holy mountain.

                             I lie down and sleep;
                                I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
                             I will not fear though tens of thousands
                                assail me on every side.

                             Arise, Lord!
                                Deliver me, my God!
                            Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
                                break the teeth of the wicked.

                             From the Lord comes deliverance.
                                May your blessing be on your people.

                             How long will you people turn my glory into shame?

                                when you are on your beds,
                                search your hearts and be silent.
                             Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
                                and trust in the Lord.

                             Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?”
                                Let the light of your face shine on us.
                             Fill my heart with joy
                                when their grain and new wine abound.

                             In peace I will lie down and sleep,

                                             In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
                                                in the morning I lay my requests before you
                                                and wait expectantly.
                                             For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness;
                                                with you, evil people are not welcome.
                                             The arrogant cannot stand
                                                in your presence.
                                            You hate all who do wrong;
                                                 you destroy those who tell lies.
                                            The bloodthirsty and deceitful
                                                you, Lord, detest.
                                             But I, by your great love,
                                                can come into your house;
                                            in reverence I bow down
                                                toward your holy temple.

                                             Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness
                                                because of my enemies—
                                                make your way straight before me.
                                             Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;
                                                their heart is filled with malice.
                                            Their throat is an open grave;
                                                with their tongues they tell lies.
                                             Declare them guilty, O God!
                                                Let their intrigues be their downfall.
                                            Banish them for their many sins,
                                                for they have rebelled against you.
                                             But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
                                                let them ever sing for joy.
                                            Spread your protection over them,
                                                that those who love your name may rejoice in you.

                                             Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
                                                you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

 Turn, Lord, and deliver me;
    save me because of your unfailing love.
 Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
    Who praises you from the grave?

 I am worn out from my groaning.

All night long I flood my bed with weeping
    and drench my couch with tears.
    My eyes grow weak with sorrow;
    they fail because of all my foes.

 Away from me, all you who do evil,
    for the Lord has heard my weeping.
 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy;
    the Lord accepts my prayer.
 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish;
    they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.

            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>PSALM 7 &darr;</h2>
            <p>( A shiggaion of David )
            which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.
 Lord my God, I take refuge in you;
    save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
 or they will tear me apart like a lion
    and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.

 Lord my God, if I have done this
    and there is guilt on my hands—
 if I have repaid my ally with evil
    or without cause have robbed my foe—
 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me;
    let him trample my life to the ground
    and make me sleep in the dust.[c]

 Arise, Lord, in your anger;
    rise up against the rage of my enemies.
    Awake, my God; decree justice.
 Let the assembled peoples gather around you,
    while you sit enthroned over them on high.
     Let the Lord judge the peoples.
Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness,
    according to my integrity, O Most High.
 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked
    and make the righteous secure—
you, the righteous God
    who probes minds and hearts.

 My shield is God Most High,
    who saves the upright in heart.
 God is a righteous judge,
    a God who displays his wrath every day.
 If he does not relent,
    he will sharpen his sword;
    he will bend and string his bow.
 He has prepared his deadly weapons;
    he makes ready his flaming arrows.

 Whoever is pregnant with evil
    conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
 Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out
    falls into the pit they have made.
 The trouble they cause recoils on them;
    their violence comes down on their own heads.

 I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness;
    I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.

                  For the director of music. According to gittith. A psalm of David.
 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!

You have set your glory
    in the heavens.
 Through the praise of children and infants
    you have established a stronghold against your enemies,
    to silence the foe and the avenger.
 When I consider your heavens,
    the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars,
    which you have set in place,
 what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
    human beings that you care for them?
 You have made them a little lower than the angels
    and crowned them with glory and honor.
 You made them rulers over the works of your hands;
    you put everything under their feet:
 all flocks and herds,
    and the animals of the wild,
 the birds in the sky,
    and the fish in the sea,
    all that swim the paths of the seas.

 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!"

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                  For the director of music. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A psalm of David.
 I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart;
    I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
    I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.

 My enemies turn back;
    they stumble and perish before you.
 For you have upheld my right and my cause,
    sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
    you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
 Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies,
    you have uprooted their cities;
    even the memory of them has perished.

 The Lord reigns forever;
    he has established his throne for judgment.
 He rules the world in righteousness
    and judges the peoples with equity.
 The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed,
    a stronghold in times of trouble.
  Those who know your name trust in you,
    for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.

 Sing the praises of the Lord, enthroned in Zion;
    proclaim among the nations what he has done.
 For he who avenges blood remembers;
    he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.

 Lord, see how my enemies persecute me!
    Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
 that I may declare your praises
    in the gates of Daughter Zion,
    and there rejoice in your salvation.

 The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug;
    their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
 The Lord is known by his acts of justice;
    the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.[c]
 The wicked go down to the realm of the dead,
    all the nations that forget God.
 But God will never forget the needy;
    the hope of the afflicted will never perish.

 Arise, Lord, do not let mortals triumph;
    let the nations be judged in your presence.
Strike them with terror, Lord;
    let the nations know they are only mortal.

            <p>
              Why, Lord, do you stand far off?
    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

 In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,
    who are caught in the schemes he devises.
 He boasts about the cravings of his heart;
    he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.
 In his pride the wicked man does not seek him;
    in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
 His ways are always prosperous;
    your laws are rejected by[b] him;
    he sneers at all his enemies.
 He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.”
    He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”

 His mouth is full of lies and threats;
    trouble and evil are under his tongue.
 He lies in wait near the villages;
    from ambush he murders the innocent.
His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
     like a lion in cover he lies in wait.
He lies in wait to catch the helpless;
    he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
 His victims are crushed, they collapse;
    they fall under his strength.
 He says to himself, “God will never notice;
    he covers his face and never sees.”

 Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God.
    Do not forget the helpless.
 Why does the wicked man revile God?
    Why does he say to himself,
    “He won’t call me to account”?
 But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted;
    you consider their grief and take it in hand.
The victims commit themselves to you;
    you are the helper of the fatherless.
 Break the arm of the wicked man;
    call the evildoer to account for his wickedness
    that would not otherwise be found out.

 The Lord is King for ever and ever;
    the nations will perish from his land.
 You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted;
    you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
 defending the fatherless and the oppressed,
    so that mere earthly mortals
    will never again strike terror.

1 In the Lord I take refuge.
    How then can you say to me:
    “Flee like a bird to your mountain.
2 For look, the wicked bend their bows;
    they set their arrows against the strings
to shoot from the shadows
    at the upright in heart.
3 When the foundations are being destroyed,
    what can the righteous do?”

4 The Lord is in his holy temple;
    the Lord is on his heavenly throne.
He observes everyone on earth;
    his eyes examine them.
5 The Lord examines the righteous,
    but the wicked, those who love violence,
    he hates with a passion.
6 On the wicked he will rain
    fiery coals and burning sulfur;
    a scorching wind will be their lot.

              For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
              1 Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;
                  those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
              2 Everyone lies to their neighbor;
                  they flatter with their lips
                  but harbor deception in their hearts.

              3 May the Lord silence all flattering lips
                  and every boastful tongue—
              4 those who say,
                  “By our tongues we will prevail;
                  our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”

              5 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
                  I will now arise,” says the Lord.
                  “I will protect them from those who malign them.”
              6 And the words of the Lord are flawless,
                  like silver purified in a crucible,
                  like gold refined seven times.

              7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe
                  and will protect us forever from the wicked,
              8 who freely strut about

5 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup;

        PSALM 18</h2>
            <p>
              For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord. He sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
1 I love you, Lord, my strength.

2 The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;
    my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,
    my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

3 I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
    and I have been saved from my enemies.
4 The cords of death entangled me;
    the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
5 The cords of the grave coiled around me;
    the snares of death confronted me.

6 In my distress I called to the Lord;
    I cried to my God for help.
From his temple he heard my voice;
    my cry came before him, into his ears.
7 The earth trembled and quaked,
    and the foundations of the mountains shook;
    they trembled because he was angry.
8 Smoke rose from his nostrils;
    consuming fire came from his mouth,
    burning coals blazed out of it.
9 He parted the heavens and came down;
    dark clouds were under his feet.
10 He mounted the cherubim and flew;
    he soared on the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—
    the dark rain clouds of the sky.
12 Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,
    with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
13 The Lord thundered from heaven;
    the voice of the Most High resounded.
14 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,
    with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
15 The valleys of the sea were exposed
    and the foundations of the earth laid bare
at your rebuke, Lord,
    at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
    he drew me out of deep waters.
17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
    from my foes, who were too strong for me.
18 They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
    but the Lord was my support.
19 He brought me out into a spacious place;
    he rescued me because he delighted in me.

20 The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;
    according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord;
    I am not guilty of turning from my God.
22 All his laws are before me;
    I have not turned away from his decrees.
23 I have been blameless before him
    and have kept myself from sin.
24 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
    according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.

25 To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
    to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
26 to the pure you show yourself pure,
    but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
27 You save the humble
    but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
28 You, Lord, keep my lamp burning;
    my God turns my darkness into light.
29 With your help I can advance against a troop[e];
    with my God I can scale a wall.

30 As for God, his way is perfect:
    The Lord’s word is flawless;
    he shields all who take refuge in him.
31 For who is God besides the Lord?
    And who is the Rock except our God?
32 It is God who arms me with strength
    and keeps my way secure.
33 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;
    he causes me to stand on the heights.
34 He trains my hands for battle;
    my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
35 You make your saving help my shield,
    and your right hand sustains me;
    your help has made me great.
36 You provide a broad path for my feet,
    so that my ankles do not give way.

37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
    I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
38 I crushed them so that they could not rise;
    they fell beneath my feet.
39 You armed me with strength for battle;
    you humbled my adversaries before me.
40 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
    and I destroyed my foes.
41 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
    to the Lord, but he did not answer.
42 I beat them as fine as windblown dust;
    I trampled them like mud in the streets.
43 You have delivered me from the attacks of the people;
    you have made me the head of nations.
People I did not know now serve me,
44     foreigners cower before me;
    as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
45 They all lose heart;
    they come trembling from their strongholds.

46 The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!
    Exalted be God my Savior!
47 He is the God who avenges me,
    who subdues nations under me,
48     who saves me from my enemies.
You exalted me above my foes;
    from a violent man you rescued me.
49 Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
    I will sing the praises of your name.

50 He gives his king great victories;
    he shows unfailing love to his anointed,
    to David and to his descendants forever.

      PSALM 19</h2>
              <p>
              For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                1 The heavens declare the glory of God;
                    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
                2 Day after day they pour forth speech;
                    night after night they reveal knowledge.
                3 They have no speech, they use no words;
                    no sound is heard from them.
                4 Yet their voice[b] goes out into all the earth,
                    their words to the ends of the world.
                In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
                5     It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
                    like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
                6 It rises at one end of the heavens
                    and makes its circuit to the other;
                    nothing is deprived of its warmth.

                7 The law of the Lord is perfect,
                    refreshing the soul.
                The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,
                    making wise the simple.
                8 The precepts of the Lord are right,
                    giving joy to the heart.
                The commands of the Lord are radiant,
                    giving light to the eyes.
                9 The fear of the Lord is pure,
                    enduring forever.
                The decrees of the Lord are firm,
                    and all of them are righteous.

                10 They are more precious than gold,
                    than much pure gold;
                they are sweeter than honey,
                    than honey from the honeycomb.
                11 By them your servant is warned;
                    in keeping them there is great reward.
                12 But who can discern their own errors?
                    Forgive my hidden faults.
                13 Keep your servant also from willful sins;
                    may they not rule over me.
                Then I will be blameless,
                    innocent of great transgression.

                14 May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart
                    be pleasing in your sight,
                    Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

      PSALM 20</h2>
              <p>
                  For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                    1 May the Lord answer you when you are in distress;
                        may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
                    2 May he send you help from the sanctuary
                        and grant you support from Zion.
                    3 May he remember all your sacrifices
                        and accept your burnt offerings.[b]
                    4 May he give you the desire of your heart
                        and make all your plans succeed.
                    5 May we shout for joy over your victory
                        and lift up our banners in the name of our God.

                    May the Lord grant all your requests.

                    6 Now this I know:
                        The Lord gives victory to his anointed.
                    He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary
                        with the victorious power of his right hand.
                    7 Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
                        but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
                    8 They are brought to their knees and fall,
                        but we rise up and stand firm.
                    9 Lord, give victory to the king!
                        Answer us when we call!

      PSALM 21</h2>
              <p>
        
          For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                  1 The king rejoices in your strength, Lord.
                      How great is his joy in the victories you give!

                  2 You have granted him his heart’s desire
                      and have not withheld the request of his lips.[b]
                  3 You came to greet him with rich blessings
                      and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
                  4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—
                      length of days, for ever and ever.
                  5 Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;
                      you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
                  6 Surely you have granted him unending blessings
                      and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
                  7 For the king trusts in the Lord;
                      through the unfailing love of the Most High

                  he will not be shaken.

                  8 Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;
                      your right hand will seize your foes.
                  9 When you appear for battle,
                      you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.
                  The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,
                      and his fire will consume them.
                  10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
                      their posterity from mankind.
                  11 Though they plot evil against you
                      and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
                  12 You will make them turn their backs
                      when you aim at them with drawn bow.

                  13 Be exalted in your strength, Lord;
                      we will sing and praise your might.

                                              For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.
                              1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
                                  Why are you so far from saving me,
                                  so far from my cries of anguish?
                              2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
                                  by night, but I find no rest.[b]

                              3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
                                  you are the one Israel praises.[c]
                              4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
                                  they trusted and you delivered them.
                              5 To you they cried out and were saved;
                                  in you they trusted and were not put to shame.

                              6 But I am a worm and not a man,
                                  scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
                              7 All who see me mock me;
                                  they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
                              8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say,
                                  “let the Lord rescue him.
                              Let him deliver him,
                                  since he delights in him.”

                              9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;
                                  you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
                              10 From birth I was cast on you;
                                  from my mother’s womb you have been my God.

                              11 Do not be far from me,
                                  for trouble is near
                                  and there is no one to help.

                              12 Many bulls surround me;
                                  strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
                              13 Roaring lions that tear their prey
                                  open their mouths wide against me.
                              14 I am poured out like water,
                                  and all my bones are out of joint.
                              My heart has turned to wax;
                                  it has melted within me.
                              15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,
                                  and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;
                                  you lay me in the dust of death.

                              16 Dogs surround me,
                                  a pack of villains encircles me;
                                  they pierce[e] my hands and my feet.
                              17 All my bones are on display;
                                  people stare and gloat over me.
                              18 They divide my clothes among them
                                  and cast lots for my garment.

                              19 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
                                  You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
                              20 Deliver me from the sword,
                                  my precious life from the power of the dogs.
                              21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
                                  save me from the horns of the wild oxen.

                              22 I will declare your name to my people;
                                  in the assembly I will praise you.
                              23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!
                                  All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
                                  Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
                              24 For he has not despised or scorned
                                  the suffering of the afflicted one;
                              he has not hidden his face from him
                                  but has listened to his cry for help.

                              25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
                                  before those who fear you[f] I will fulfill my vows.
                              26 The poor will eat and be satisfied;
                                  those who seek the Lord will praise him—
                                  may your hearts live forever!

                              27 All the ends of the earth
                                  will remember and turn to the Lord,
                              and all the families of the nations
                                  will bow down before him,
                              28 for dominion belongs to the Lord
                                  and he rules over the nations.

                              29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
                                  all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
                                  those who cannot keep themselves alive.
                              30 Posterity will serve him;
                                  future generations will be told about the Lord.
                              31 They will proclaim his righteousness,
                                  declaring to a people yet unborn:
                                  He has done it!

                                    2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,
                                    he leads me beside quiet waters,
                                    3     he refreshes my soul.
                                    He guides me along the right paths

                                        they comfort me.

                                    You anoint my head with oil;
                                        my cup overflows.
                                    6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me

                                      <p>
                                          Of David. A psalm.
                                        1 The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it,
                                            the world, and all who live in it;
                                        2 for he founded it on the seas
                                            and established it on the waters.

                                        3 Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?
                                            Who may stand in his holy place?
                                        4 The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,
                                            who does not trust in an idol
                                            or swear by a false god.[a]

                                        5 They will receive blessing from the Lord
                                            and vindication from God their Savior.
                                        6 Such is the generation of those who seek him,
                                            who seek your face, God of Jacob.[b][c]

                                        7 Lift up your heads, you gates;
                                            be lifted up, you ancient doors,
                                            that the King of glory may come in.
                                        8 Who is this King of glory?
                                            The Lord strong and mighty,
                                            the Lord mighty in battle.
                                        9 Lift up your heads, you gates;
                                            lift them up, you ancient doors,
                                            that the King of glory may come in.
                                        10 Who is he, this King of glory?
                                            The Lord Almighty—
                                            he is the King of glory.

                                       Of David.
                                        1 In you, Lord my God,
                                            I put my trust.

                                        2 I trust in you;
                                            do not let me be put to shame,
                                            nor let my enemies triumph over me.
                                        3 No one who hopes in you
                                            will ever be put to shame,
                                        but shame will come on those
                                            who are treacherous without cause.

                                        4 Show me your ways, Lord,
                                            teach me your paths.
                                        5 Guide me in your truth and teach me,
                                            for you are God my Savior,
                                            and my hope is in you all day long.
                                        6 Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love,
                                            for they are from of old.
                                        7 Do not remember the sins of my youth
                                            and my rebellious ways;
                                        according to your love remember me,
                                            for you, Lord, are good.

                                        8 Good and upright is the Lord;
                                            therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
                                        9 He guides the humble in what is right
                                            and teaches them his way.
                                        10 All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful
                                            toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
                                        11 For the sake of your name, Lord,
                                            forgive my iniquity, though it is great.

                                        12 Who, then, are those who fear the Lord?
                                            He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.[b]
                                        13 They will spend their days in prosperity,
                                            and their descendants will inherit the land.
                                        14 The Lord confides in those who fear him;
                                            he makes his covenant known to them.
                                        15 My eyes are ever on the Lord,
                                            for only he will release my feet from the snare.

                                        16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
                                            for I am lonely and afflicted.
                                        17 Relieve the troubles of my heart
                                            and free me from my anguish.
                                        18 Look on my affliction and my distress
                                            and take away all my sins.
                                        19 See how numerous are my enemies
                                            and how fiercely they hate me!

                                        20 Guard my life and rescue me;
                                            do not let me be put to shame,
                                            for I take refuge in you.
                                        21 May integrity and uprightness protect me,
                                            because my hope, Lord,[c] is in you.

                                          1 Vindicate me, Lord,
                                              for I have led a blameless life;
                                          I have trusted in the Lord
                                              and have not faltered.
                                          2 Test me, Lord, and try me,
                                              examine my heart and my mind;
                                          3 for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love
                                              and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.

                                          4 I do not sit with the deceitful,
                                              nor do I associate with hypocrites.
                                          5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers
                                              and refuse to sit with the wicked.
                                          6 I wash my hands in innocence,
                                              and go about your altar, Lord,
                                          7 proclaiming aloud your praise
                                              and telling of all your wonderful deeds.

                                          8 Lord, I love the house where you live,
                                              the place where your glory dwells.
                                          9 Do not take away my soul along with sinners,
                                              my life with those who are bloodthirsty,
                                          10 in whose hands are wicked schemes,
                                              whose right hands are full of bribes.
                                          11 I lead a blameless life;
                                              deliver me and be merciful to me.

                                          12 My feet stand on level ground;

                                                  whom shall I fear?

                                              2 When the wicked advance against me
                                                  to devour[a] me,
                                              it is my enemies and my foes
                                                  who will stumble and fall.
                                              3 Though an army besiege me,
                                                  my heart will not fear;
                                              though war break out against me,
                                                  even then I will be confident.

                                              4 One thing I ask from the Lord,
                                                  this only do I seek:
                                              that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
                                                  all the days of my life,
                                              to gaze on the beauty of the Lord
                                                  and to seek him in his temple.
                                              5 For in the day of trouble
                                                  he will keep me safe in his dwelling;
                                              he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent
                                                  and set me high upon a rock.

                                              6 Then my head will be exalted
                                                  above the enemies who surround me;
                                              at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy;
                                                  I will sing and make music to the Lord.

                                              7 Hear my voice when I call, Lord;
                                                  be merciful to me and answer me.
                                              8 My heart says of you, “Seek his face!”
                                                  Your face, Lord, I will seek.
                                              9 Do not hide your face from me,
                                                  do not turn your servant away in anger;
                                                  you have been my helper.
                                              Do not reject me or forsake me,
                                                  God my Savior.
                                              10 Though my father and mother forsake me,
                                                  the Lord will receive me.
                                              11 Teach me your way, Lord;
                                                  lead me in a straight path
                                                  because of my oppressors.
                                              12 Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes,
                                                  for false witnesses rise up against me,
                                                  spouting malicious accusations.

                                              13 I remain confident of this:
                                                  I will see the goodness of the Lord
                                                  in the land of the living.
                                              14 Wait for the Lord;
                                                  be strong and take heart
                                                  and wait for the Lord.

                                       Of David.
                                        1 To you, Lord, I call;
                                            you are my Rock,
                                            do not turn a deaf ear to me.
                                        For if you remain silent,
                                            I will be like those who go down to the pit.
                                        2 Hear my cry for mercy
                                            as I call to you for help,
                                        as I lift up my hands
                                            toward your Most Holy Place.

                                        3 Do not drag me away with the wicked,
                                            with those who do evil,
                                        who speak cordially with their neighbors
                                            but harbor malice in their hearts.
                                        4 Repay them for their deeds
                                            and for their evil work;
                                        repay them for what their hands have done
                                            and bring back on them what they deserve.

                                        5 Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord
                                            and what his hands have done,
                                        he will tear them down
                                            and never build them up again.

                                        6 Praise be to the Lord,
                                            for he has heard my cry for mercy.
                                        7 The Lord is my strength and my shield;
                                            my heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
                                        My heart leaps for joy,
                                            and with my song I praise him.

                                        8 The Lord is the strength of his people,
                                            a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
                                        9 Save your people and bless your inheritance;
                                            be their shepherd and carry them forever.

                                       A psalm of David.
                                            1 Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings,
                                                ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
                                            2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
                                                worship the Lord in the splendor of his[a] holiness.

                                            3 The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
                                                the God of glory thunders,
                                                the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
                                            4 The voice of the Lord is powerful;
                                                the voice of the Lord is majestic.
                                            5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
                                                the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
                                            6 He makes Lebanon leap like a calf,
                                                Sirion[b] like a young wild ox.
                                            7 The voice of the Lord strikes
                                                with flashes of lightning.
                                            8 The voice of the Lord shakes the desert;
                                                the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
                                            9 The voice of the Lord twists the oaks[c]
                                                and strips the forests bare.
                                            And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”

                                            10 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
                                                the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
                                            11 The Lord gives strength to his people;
                                                the Lord blesses his people with peace

                                       A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple.[b] Of David.
                                            1 I will exalt you, Lord,
                                                for you lifted me out of the depths
                                                and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
                                            2 Lord my God, I called to you for help,
                                                and you healed me.
                                            3 You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead;
                                                you spared me from going down to the pit.

                                            4 Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people;
                                                praise his holy name.
                                            5 For his anger lasts only a moment,
                                                but his favor lasts a lifetime;
                                            weeping may stay for the night,
                                                but rejoicing comes in the morning.

                                            6 When I felt secure, I said,
                                                “I will never be shaken.”
                                            7 Lord, when you favored me,
                                                you made my royal mountain[c] stand firm;
                                            but when you hid your face,
                                                I was dismayed.

                                            8 To you, Lord, I called;
                                                to the Lord I cried for mercy:
                                            9 “What is gained if I am silenced,
                                                if I go down to the pit?
                                            Will the dust praise you?
                                                Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
                                            10 Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me;
                                                Lord, be my help.”

                                            11 You turned my wailing into dancing;
                                                you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
                                            12 that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.
                                                Lord my God, I will praise you forever.

                                          1 In you, Lord, I have taken refuge;
                                              let me never be put to shame;
                                              deliver me in your righteousness.
                                          2 Turn your ear to me,
                                              come quickly to my rescue;
                                          be my rock of refuge,
                                              a strong fortress to save me.
                                          3 Since you are my rock and my fortress,
                                              for the sake of your name lead and guide me.
                                          4 Keep me free from the trap that is set for me,
                                              for you are my refuge.
                                          5 Into your hands I commit my spirit;
                                              deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.

                                          6 I hate those who cling to worthless idols;
                                              as for me, I trust in the Lord.
                                          7 I will be glad and rejoice in your love,
                                              for you saw my affliction
                                              and knew the anguish of my soul.
                                          8 You have not given me into the hands of the enemy
                                              but have set my feet in a spacious place.

                                          9 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am in distress;
                                              my eyes grow weak with sorrow,
                                              my soul and body with grief.
                                          10 My life is consumed by anguish
                                              and my years by groaning;
                                          my strength fails because of my affliction,[b]
                                              and my bones grow weak.
                                          11 Because of all my enemies,
                                              I am the utter contempt of my neighbors
                                          and an object of dread to my closest friends—
                                              those who see me on the street flee from me.
                                          12 I am forgotten as though I were dead;
                                              I have become like broken pottery.
                                          13 For I hear many whispering,
                                              “Terror on every side!”
                                          They conspire against me
                                              and plot to take my life.

                                          14 But I trust in you, Lord;
                                              I say, “You are my God.”
                                          15 My times are in your hands;
                                              deliver me from the hands of my enemies,
                                              from those who pursue me.
                                          16 Let your face shine on your servant;
                                              save me in your unfailing love.
                                          17 Let me not be put to shame, Lord,
                                              for I have cried out to you;
                                          but let the wicked be put to shame
                                              and be silent in the realm of the dead.
                                          18 Let their lying lips be silenced,
                                              for with pride and contempt
                                              they speak arrogantly against the righteous.

                                          19 How abundant are the good things
                                              that you have stored up for those who fear you,
                                          that you bestow in the sight of all,
                                              on those who take refuge in you.
                                          20 In the shelter of your presence you hide them
                                              from all human intrigues;
                                          you keep them safe in your dwelling
                                              from accusing tongues.

                                          21 Praise be to the Lord,
                                              for he showed me the wonders of his love
                                              when I was in a city under siege.
                                          22 In my alarm I said,
                                              “I am cut off from your sight!”
                                          Yet you heard my cry for mercy
                                              when I called to you for help.

                                          23 Love the Lord, all his faithful people!
                                              The Lord preserves those who are true to him,
                                              but the proud he pays back in full.
                                          24 Be strong and take heart,
                                              all you who hope in the Lord.

                                       Of David. A maskil.[a]
                                        1 Blessed is the one
                                            whose transgressions are forgiven,
                                            whose sins are covered.
                                        2 Blessed is the one
                                            whose sin the Lord does not count against them
                                            and in whose spirit is no deceit.

                                        3 When I kept silent,
                                            my bones wasted away
                                            through my groaning all day long.
                                        4 For day and night
                                            your hand was heavy on me;
                                        my strength was sapped
                                            as in the heat of summer.[b]

                                        5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you
                                            and did not cover up my iniquity.
                                        I said, “I will confess
                                            my transgressions to the Lord.”
                                        And you forgave
                                            the guilt of my sin.

                                        6 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you
                                            while you may be found;
                                        surely the rising of the mighty waters
                                            will not reach them.
                                        7 You are my hiding place;
                                            you will protect me from trouble
                                            and surround me with songs of deliverance.

                                        8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
                                            I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
                                        9 Do not be like the horse or the mule,
                                            which have no understanding
                                        but must be controlled by bit and bridle
                                            or they will not come to you.
                                        10 Many are the woes of the wicked,
                                            but the Lord’s unfailing love
                                            surrounds the one who trusts in him.

                                        11 Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;
                                            sing, all you who are upright in heart!

                                              1 Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous;
                                                it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
                                            2 Praise the Lord with the harp;

                                            4 For the word of the Lord is right and true;
                                                he is faithful in all he does.
                                            5 The Lord loves righteousness and justice;
                                                the earth is full of his unfailing love.

                                            6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
                                                their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
                                            7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars[a];
                                                he puts the deep into storehouses.
                                            8 Let all the earth fear the Lord;
                                                let all the people of the world revere him.
                                            9 For he spoke, and it came to be;
                                                he commanded, and it stood firm.

                                            10 The Lord foils the plans of the nations;
                                                he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
                                            11 But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever,
                                                the purposes of his heart through all generations.

                                            13 From heaven the Lord looks down
                                                and sees all mankind;
                                            14 from his dwelling place he watches
                                                all who live on earth—
                                            15 he who forms the hearts of all,

                                            17 A horse is a vain hope for deliverance;
                                                despite all its great strength it cannot save.
                                            18 But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him,

                                                he is our help and our shield.
                                            21 In him our hearts rejoice,
                                                for we trust in his holy name.

                                              1 I will extol the Lord at all times;
                                                  his praise will always be on my lips.
                                              2 I will glory in the Lord;
                                                  let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
                                              3 Glorify the Lord with me;
                                                  let us exalt his name together.

                                              4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
                                                  he delivered me from all my fears.
                                              5 Those who look to him are radiant;
                                                  their faces are never covered with shame.
                                              6 This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;
                                                  he saved him out of all his troubles.
                                              7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
                                                  and he delivers them.

                                              8 Taste and see that the Lord is good;
                                                  blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
                                              9 Fear the Lord, you his holy people,
                                                  for those who fear him lack nothing.
                                              10 The lions may grow weak and hungry,
                                                  but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
                                              11 Come, my children, listen to me;
                                                  I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
                                              12 Whoever of you loves life
                                                  and desires to see many good days,
                                              13 keep your tongue from evil
                                                  and your lips from telling lies.
                                              14 Turn from evil and do good;
                                                  seek peace and pursue it.

                                              15 The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
                                                  and his ears are attentive to their cry;
                                              16 but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil,
                                                  to blot out their name from the earth.

                                              17 The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;
                                                  he delivers them from all their troubles.
                                              18 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
                                                  and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

                                              19 The righteous person may have many troubles,
                                                  but the Lord delivers him from them all;
                                              20 he protects all his bones,
                                                  not one of them will be broken.

                                              21 Evil will slay the wicked;
                                                  the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
                                              22 The Lord will rescue his servants;
                                                  no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.

                                       Of David.
                                          1 Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me;
                                              fight against those who fight against me.
                                          2 Take up shield and armor;
                                              arise and come to my aid.
                                          3 Brandish spear and javelin[a]
                                              against those who pursue me.
                                          Say to me,
                                              “I am your salvation.”

                                          4 May those who seek my life
                                              be disgraced and put to shame;
                                          may those who plot my ruin
                                              be turned back in dismay.
                                          5 May they be like chaff before the wind,
                                              with the angel of the Lord driving them away;
                                          6 may their path be dark and slippery,
                                              with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.

                                          7 Since they hid their net for me without cause
                                              and without cause dug a pit for me,
                                          8 may ruin overtake them by surprise—
                                              may the net they hid entangle them,
                                              may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
                                          9 Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord
                                              and delight in his salvation.
                                          10 My whole being will exclaim,
                                              “Who is like you, Lord?
                                          You rescue the poor from those too strong for them,
                                              the poor and needy from those who rob them.”

                                          11 Ruthless witnesses come forward;
                                              they question me on things I know nothing about.
                                          12 They repay me evil for good
                                              and leave me like one bereaved.
                                          13 Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth
                                              and humbled myself with fasting.
                                          When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
                                          14     I went about mourning
                                              as though for my friend or brother.
                                          I bowed my head in grief
                                              as though weeping for my mother.
                                          15 But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee;
                                              assailants gathered against me without my knowledge.
                                              They slandered me without ceasing.
                                          16 Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;[b]
                                              they gnashed their teeth at me.

                                          17 How long, Lord, will you look on?
                                              Rescue me from their ravages,
                                              my precious life from these lions.
                                          18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly;
                                              among the throngs I will praise you.
                                          19 Do not let those gloat over me
                                              who are my enemies without cause;
                                          do not let those who hate me without reason
                                              maliciously wink the eye.
                                          20 They do not speak peaceably,
                                              but devise false accusations
                                              against those who live quietly in the land.
                                          21 They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha!
                                              With our own eyes we have seen it.”

                                          22 Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent.
                                              Do not be far from me, Lord.
                                          23 Awake, and rise to my defense!
                                              Contend for me, my God and Lord.
                                          24 Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God;
                                              do not let them gloat over me.
                                          25 Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!”
                                              or say, “We have swallowed him up.”

                                          26 May all who gloat over my distress
                                              be put to shame and confusion;
                                          may all who exalt themselves over me
                                              be clothed with shame and disgrace.
                                          27 May those who delight in my vindication
                                              shout for joy and gladness;
                                          may they always say, “The Lord be exalted,
                                              who delights in the well-being of his servant.”

                                          28 My tongue will proclaim your righteousness,
                                              your praises all day long.

                                       For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.
                                            1 I have a message from God in my heart
                                                concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:[b]
                                            There is no fear of God
                                                before their eyes.

                                            2 In their own eyes they flatter themselves
                                                too much to detect or hate their sin.
                                            3 The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful;
                                                they fail to act wisely or do good.
                                            4 Even on their beds they plot evil;
                                                they commit themselves to a sinful course
                                                and do not reject what is wrong.

                                            5 Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens,
                                                your faithfulness to the skies.
                                            6 Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
                                                your justice like the great deep.
                                                You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.
                                            7 How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
                                                People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
                                            8 They feast on the abundance of your house;
                                                you give them drink from your river of delights.
                                            9 For with you is the fountain of life;
                                                in your light we see light.

                                            10 Continue your love to those who know you,
                                                your righteousness to the upright in heart.
                                            11 May the foot of the proud not come against me,
                                                nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
                                            12 See how the evildoers lie fallen—
                                                thrown down, not able to rise!
                                      </p>

                                       Of David.
                                            1 Do not fret because of those who are evil
                                                or be envious of those who do wrong;
                                            2 for like the grass they will soon wither,
                                                like green plants they will soon die away.

                                            3 Trust in the Lord and do good;
                                                dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
                                            4 Take delight in the Lord,
                                                and he will give you the desires of your heart.

                                            5 Commit your way to the Lord;
                                                trust in him and he will do this:
                                            6 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,
                                                your vindication like the noonday sun.

                                            7 Be still before the Lord
                                                and wait patiently for him;
                                            do not fret when people succeed in their ways,
                                                when they carry out their wicked schemes.

                                            8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;
                                                do not fret—it leads only to evil.
                                            9 For those who are evil will be destroyed,
                                                but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.

                                            10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more;
                                                though you look for them, they will not be found.
                                            11 But the meek will inherit the land
                                                and enjoy peace and prosperity.

                                            12 The wicked plot against the righteous
                                                and gnash their teeth at them;
                                            13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
                                                for he knows their day is coming.

                                            14 The wicked draw the sword
                                                and bend the bow
                                            to bring down the poor and needy,
                                                to slay those whose ways are upright.
                                            15 But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
                                                and their bows will be broken.

                                            16 Better the little that the righteous have
                                                than the wealth of many wicked;
                                            17 for the power of the wicked will be broken,
                                                but the Lord upholds the righteous.

                                            18 The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care,
                                                and their inheritance will endure forever.
                                            19 In times of disaster they will not wither;
                                                in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.

                                            20 But the wicked will perish:
                                                Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field,
                                                they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.

                                            21 The wicked borrow and do not repay,
                                                but the righteous give generously;
                                            22 those the Lord blesses will inherit the land,
                                                but those he curses will be destroyed.

                                            23 The Lord makes firm the steps
                                                of the one who delights in him;
                                            24 though he may stumble, he will not fall,
                                                for the Lord upholds him with his hand.

                                            25 I was young and now I am old,
                                                yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken
                                                or their children begging bread.
                                            26 They are always generous and lend freely;
                                                their children will be a blessing.[b]

                                            27 Turn from evil and do good;
                                                then you will dwell in the land forever.
                                            28 For the Lord loves the just
                                                and will not forsake his faithful ones.

                                            Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed[c];
                                                the offspring of the wicked will perish.
                                            29 The righteous will inherit the land
                                                and dwell in it forever.

                                            30 The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,
                                                and their tongues speak what is just.
                                            31 The law of their God is in their hearts;
                                                their feet do not slip.

                                            32 The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
                                                intent on putting them to death;
                                            33 but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked
                                                or let them be condemned when brought to trial.

                                            34 Hope in the Lord
                                                and keep his way.
                                            He will exalt you to inherit the land;
                                                when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.

                                            35 I have seen a wicked and ruthless man
                                                flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
                                            36 but he soon passed away and was no more;
                                                though I looked for him, he could not be found.

                                            37 Consider the blameless, observe the upright;
                                                a future awaits those who seek peace.[d]
                                            38 But all sinners will be destroyed;
                                                there will be no future[e] for the wicked.

                                            39 The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord;
                                                he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
                                            40 The Lord helps them and delivers them;
                                                he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,
                                                because they take refuge in him.

                                       A psalm of David. A petition.
                                          1 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger
                                              or discipline me in your wrath.
                                          2 Your arrows have pierced me,
                                              and your hand has come down on me.
                                          3 Because of your wrath there is no health in my body;
                                              there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
                                          4 My guilt has overwhelmed me
                                              like a burden too heavy to bear.

                                          5 My wounds fester and are loathsome
                                              because of my sinful folly.
                                          6 I am bowed down and brought very low;
                                              all day long I go about mourning.
                                          7 My back is filled with searing pain;
                                              there is no health in my body.
                                          8 I am feeble and utterly crushed;
                                              I groan in anguish of heart.

                                          9 All my longings lie open before you, Lord;
                                              my sighing is not hidden from you.
                                          10 My heart pounds, my strength fails me;
                                              even the light has gone from my eyes.
                                          11 My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds;
                                              my neighbors stay far away.
                                          12 Those who want to kill me set their traps,
                                              those who would harm me talk of my ruin;
                                              all day long they scheme and lie.

                                          13 I am like the deaf, who cannot hear,
                                              like the mute, who cannot speak;
                                          14 I have become like one who does not hear,
                                              whose mouth can offer no reply.
                                          15 Lord, I wait for you;
                                              you will answer, Lord my God.
                                          16 For I said, “Do not let them gloat
                                              or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”

                                          17 For I am about to fall,
                                              and my pain is ever with me.
                                          18 I confess my iniquity;
                                              I am troubled by my sin.
                                          19 Many have become my enemies without cause[b];
                                              those who hate me without reason are numerous.
                                          20 Those who repay my good with evil
                                              lodge accusations against me,
                                              though I seek only to do what is good.

                                          21 Lord, do not forsake me;
                                              do not be far from me, my God.
                                          22 Come quickly to help me,
                                              my Lord and my Savior.

                                      <p>
                                       For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
                                            1 I said, “I will watch my ways
                                                and keep my tongue from sin;
                                            I will put a muzzle on my mouth
                                                while in the presence of the wicked.”
                                            2 So I remained utterly silent,
                                                not even saying anything good.
                                            But my anguish increased;
                                            3     my heart grew hot within me.
                                            While I meditated, the fire burned;
                                                then I spoke with my tongue:

                                            4 “Show me, Lord, my life’s end
                                                and the number of my days;
                                                let me know how fleeting my life is.
                                            5 You have made my days a mere handbreadth;
                                                the span of my years is as nothing before you.
                                            Everyone is but a breath,
                                                even those who seem secure.[b]

                                            6 “Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom;
                                                in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth
                                                without knowing whose it will finally be.

                                            7 “But now, Lord, what do I look for?
                                                My hope is in you.
                                            8 Save me from all my transgressions;
                                                do not make me the scorn of fools.
                                            9 I was silent; I would not open my mouth,
                                                for you are the one who has done this.
                                            10 Remove your scourge from me;
                                                I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
                                            11 When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,
                                                you consume their wealth like a moth—
                                                surely everyone is but a breath.

                                            12 “Hear my prayer, Lord,
                                                listen to my cry for help;
                                                do not be deaf to my weeping.
                                            I dwell with you as a foreigner,
                                                a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
                                            13 Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again
                                                before I depart and am no more.”             
                                      </p>
                              </div>

                                            For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.
                                            1 I waited patiently for the Lord;
                                                he turned to me and heard my cry.
                                            2 He lifted me out of the slimy pit,
                                                out of the mud and mire;
                                            he set my feet on a rock
                                                and gave me a firm place to stand.
                                            3 He put a new song in my mouth,
                                                a hymn of praise to our God.
                                            Many will see and fear the Lord
                                                and put their trust in him.

                                            4 Blessed is the one
                                                who trusts in the Lord,
                                            who does not look to the proud,
                                                to those who turn aside to false gods.[b]
                                            5 Many, Lord my God,
                                                are the wonders you have done,
                                                the things you planned for us.
                                            None can compare with you;
                                                were I to speak and tell of your deeds,
                                                they would be too many to declare.

                                            6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire—
                                                but my ears you have opened[c]—
                                                burnt offerings and sin offerings[d] you did not require.
                                            7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—
                                                it is written about me in the scroll.[e]
                                            8 I desire to do your will, my God;
                                                your law is within my heart.”

                                            9 I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;
                                                I do not seal my lips, Lord,
                                                as you know.
                                            10 I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;
                                                I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.
                                            I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness
                                                from the great assembly.

                                            11 Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord;
                                                may your love and faithfulness always protect me.
                                            12 For troubles without number surround me;
                                                my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.
                                            They are more than the hairs of my head,
                                                and my heart fails within me.
                                            13 Be pleased to save me, Lord;
                                                come quickly, Lord, to help me.

                                            14 May all who want to take my life
                                                be put to shame and confusion;
                                            may all who desire my ruin
                                                be turned back in disgrace.
                                            15 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
                                                be appalled at their own shame.
                                            16 But may all who seek you
                                                rejoice and be glad in you;
                                            may those who long for your saving help always say,
                                                “The Lord is great!”

                                            17 But as for me, I am poor and needy;
                                                may the Lord think of me.
                                            You are my help and my deliverer;
                                                you are my God, do not delay.
                                      </p>

                                       For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                                      1 Blessed are those who have regard for the weak;
                                          the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.
                                      2 The Lord protects and preserves them—
                                          they are counted among the blessed in the land—
                                          he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.
                                      3 The Lord sustains them on their sickbed
                                          and restores them from their bed of illness.

                                      4 I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord;
                                          heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
                                      5 My enemies say of me in malice,
                                          “When will he die and his name perish?”
                                      6 When one of them comes to see me,
                                          he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander;
                                          then he goes out and spreads it around.

                                      7 All my enemies whisper together against me;
                                          they imagine the worst for me, saying,
                                      8 “A vile disease has afflicted him;
                                          he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
                                      9 Even my close friend,
                                          someone I trusted,
                                      one who shared my bread,
                                          has turned[b] against me.

                                      10 But may you have mercy on me, Lord;
                                          raise me up, that I may repay them.
                                      11 I know that you are pleased with me,
                                          for my enemy does not triumph over me.
                                      12 Because of my integrity you uphold me
                                          and set me in your presence forever.

                                      13 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
                                          from everlasting to everlasting.
                                      Amen and Amen.

                                       For the director of music. A maskil of the Sons of Korah.
                              1 As the deer pants for streams of water,
                                  so my soul pants for you, my God.
                              2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
                                  When can I go and meet with God?
                              3 My tears have been my food
                                  day and night,
                              while people say to me all day long,
                                  “Where is your God?”
                              4 These things I remember
                                  as I pour out my soul:
                              how I used to go to the house of God
                                  under the protection of the Mighty One[d]
                              with shouts of joy and praise
                                  among the festive throng.

                              5 Why, my soul, are you downcast?
                                  Why so disturbed within me?
                              Put your hope in God,
                                  for I will yet praise him,
                                  my Savior and my God.

                              6 My soul is downcast within me;
                                  therefore I will remember you
                              from the land of the Jordan,
                                  the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.
                              7 Deep calls to deep
                                  in the roar of your waterfalls;
                              all your waves and breakers
                                  have swept over me.

                              8 By day the Lord directs his love,
                                  at night his song is with me—
                                  a prayer to the God of my life.

                              9 I say to God my Rock,
                                  “Why have you forgotten me?
                              Why must I go about mourning,
                                  oppressed by the enemy?”
                              10 My bones suffer mortal agony
                                  as my foes taunt me,
                              saying to me all day long,
                                  “Where is your God?”

                              11 Why, my soul, are you downcast?
                                  Why so disturbed within me?
                              Put your hope in God,
                                  for I will yet praise him,

                                          against an unfaithful nation.
                                      Rescue me from those who are
                                          deceitful and wicked.

                                          let them lead me;

                                       For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil.[b]
                                    1 We have heard it with our ears, O God;
                                        our ancestors have told us
                                    what you did in their days,
                                        in days long ago.
                                    2 With your hand you drove out the nations
                                        and planted our ancestors;
                                    you crushed the peoples
                                        and made our ancestors flourish.
                                    3 It was not by their sword that they won the land,
                                        nor did their arm bring them victory;
                                    it was your right hand, your arm,
                                        and the light of your face, for you loved them.

                                    4 You are my King and my God,
                                        who decrees victories for Jacob.
                                    5 Through you we push back our enemies;
                                        through your name we trample our foes.
                                    6 I put no trust in my bow,
                                        my sword does not bring me victory;
                                    7 but you give us victory over our enemies,
                                        you put our adversaries to shame.
                                    8 In God we make our boast all day long,
                                        and we will praise your name forever.[d]

                                    9 But now you have rejected and humbled us;
                                        you no longer go out with our armies.
                                    10 You made us retreat before the enemy,
                                        and our adversaries have plundered us.
                                    11 You gave us up to be devoured like sheep
                                        and have scattered us among the nations.
                                    12 You sold your people for a pittance,
                                        gaining nothing from their sale.

                                    13 You have made us a reproach to our neighbors,
                                        the scorn and derision of those around us.
                                    14 You have made us a byword among the nations;
                                        the peoples shake their heads at us.
                                    15 I live in disgrace all day long,
                                        and my face is covered with shame
                                    16 at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me,
                                        because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.

                                    17 All this came upon us,
                                        though we had not forgotten you;
                                        we had not been false to your covenant.
                                    18 Our hearts had not turned back;
                                        our feet had not strayed from your path.
                                    19 But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals;
                                        you covered us over with deep darkness.

                                    20 If we had forgotten the name of our God
                                        or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
                                    21 would not God have discovered it,
                                        since he knows the secrets of the heart?
                                    22 Yet for your sake we face death all day long;
                                        we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.

                                    23 Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep?
                                        Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
                                    24 Why do you hide your face
                                        and forget our misery and oppression?

                                    25 We are brought down to the dust;
                                        our bodies cling to the ground.
                                    26 Rise up and help us;
                                        rescue us because of your unfailing love.

                                            as I recite my verses for the king;
                                            my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.

                                        2 You are the most excellent of men
                                            and your lips have been anointed with grace,
                                            since God has blessed you forever.

                                        3 Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one;
                                            clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
                                        4 In your majesty ride forth victoriously
                                            in the cause of truth, humility and justice;
                                            let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.
                                        5 Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies;
                                            let the nations fall beneath your feet.
                                        6 Your throne, O God,[c] will last for ever and ever;
                                            a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
                                        7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness;
                                            therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions

                                        8 All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia;
                                            from palaces adorned with ivory
                                            the music of the strings makes you glad.
                                        9 Daughters of kings are among your honored women;
                                            at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.

                                        10 Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention:
                                            Forget your people and your father’s house.
                                        11 Let the king be enthralled by your beauty;
                                            honor him, for he is your lord.
                                        12 The city of Tyre will come with a gift,[d]
                                            people of wealth will seek your favor.
                                        13 All glorious is the princess within her chamber;
                                            her gown is interwoven with gold.
                                        14 In embroidered garments she is led to the king;
                                            her virgin companions follow her—
                                            those brought to be with her.
                                        15 Led in with joy and gladness,
                                            they enter the palace of the king.

                                        16 Your sons will take the place of your fathers;
                                            you will make them princes throughout the land.

                                        17 I will perpetuate your memory through all generations;
                                            therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.

                                      1 God is our refuge and strength,
                                          an ever-present help in trouble.
                                      2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way
                                          and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
                                      3 though its waters roar and foam
                                          and the mountains quake with their surging.[c]

                                      4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
                                          the holy place where the Most High dwells.
                                      5 God is within her, she will not fall;
                                          God will help her at break of day.
                                      6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;
                                          he lifts his voice, the earth melts.

                                      7 The Lord Almighty is with us;
                                          the God of Jacob is our fortress.

                                      8 Come and see what the Lord has done,
                                          the desolations he has brought on the earth.
                                      9 He makes wars cease
                                          to the ends of the earth.
                                      He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;
                                          he burns the shields[d] with fire.
                                      10 He says, “Be still, and know that I am God;
                                          I will be exalted among the nations,
                                          I will be exalted in the earth.”

                                      11 The Lord Almighty is with us;

                                        shout to God with cries of joy.

                                    2 For the Lord Most High is awesome,
                                        the great King over all the earth.
                                    3 He subdued nations under us,

                                    4 He chose our inheritance for us,

                                    5 God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
                                        the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
                                    6 Sing praises to God, sing praises;
                                        sing praises to our King, sing praises.
                                    7 For God is the King of all the earth;
                                        sing to him a psalm of praise.

                              1 Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise,
                                  in the city of our God, his holy mountain.

                              2 Beautiful in its loftiness,
                                  the joy of the whole earth,
                              like the heights of Zaphon[b] is Mount Zion,
                                  the city of the Great King.
                              3 God is in her citadels;
                                  he has shown himself to be her fortress.

                              4 When the kings joined forces,
                                  when they advanced together,
                              5 they saw her and were astounded;
                                  they fled in terror.
                              6 Trembling seized them there,
                                  pain like that of a woman in labor.
                              7 You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish
                                  shattered by an east wind.

                              8 As we have heard,
                                  so we have seen
                              in the city of the Lord Almighty,
                                  in the city of our God:
                              God makes her secure
                                  forever.

                              9 Within your temple, O God,
                                  we meditate on your unfailing love.
                              10 Like your name, O God,
                                  your praise reaches to the ends of the earth;
                                  your right hand is filled with righteousness.
                              11 Mount Zion rejoices,
                                  the villages of Judah are glad
                                  because of your judgments.

                              12 Walk about Zion, go around her,
                                  count her towers,
                              13 consider well her ramparts,
                                  view her citadels,
                              that you may tell of them
                                  to the next generation.

                              14 For this God is our God for ever and ever;
                                  he will be our guide even to the end.

                                    1 Hear this, all you peoples;
                                        listen, all who live in this world,
                                    2 both low and high,
                                        rich and poor alike:
                                    3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom;
                                        the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.
                                    4 I will turn my ear to a proverb;
                                        with the harp I will expound my riddle:

                                    5 Why should I fear when evil days come,
                                        when wicked deceivers surround me—
                                    6 those who trust in their wealth
                                        and boast of their great riches?
                                    7 No one can redeem the life of another
                                        or give to God a ransom for them—
                                    8 the ransom for a life is costly,
                                        no payment is ever enough—
                                    9 so that they should live on forever
                                        and not see decay.
                                    10 For all can see that the wise die,
                                        that the foolish and the senseless also perish,
                                        leaving their wealth to others.
                                    11 Their tombs will remain their houses forever,
                                        their dwellings for endless generations,
                                        though they had named lands after themselves.

                                    12 People, despite their wealth, do not endure;
                                        they are like the beasts that perish.

                                    13 This is the fate of those who trust in themselves,
                                        and of their followers, who approve their sayings.
                                    14 They are like sheep and are destined to die;
                                        death will be their shepherd
                                        (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning).
                                    Their forms will decay in the grave,
                                        far from their princely mansions.
                                    15 But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead;
                                        he will surely take me to himself.
                                    16 Do not be overawed when others grow rich,
                                        when the splendor of their houses increases;
                                    17 for they will take nothing with them when they die,
                                        their splendor will not descend with them.
                                    18 Though while they live they count themselves blessed—
                                        and people praise you when you prosper—
                                    19 they will join those who have gone before them,
                                        who will never again see the light of life.

                                       A psalm of Asaph.
                                    1 The Mighty One, God, the Lord,
                                        speaks and summons the earth
                                        from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
                                    2 From Zion, perfect in beauty,
                                        God shines forth.
                                    3 Our God comes
                                        and will not be silent;
                                    a fire devours before him,
                                        and around him a tempest rages.
                                    4 He summons the heavens above,
                                        and the earth, that he may judge his people:
                                    5 “Gather to me this consecrated people,
                                        who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
                                    6 And the heavens proclaim his righteousness,
                                        for he is a God of justice.

                                    7 “Listen, my people, and I will speak;
                                        I will testify against you, Israel:
                                        I am God, your God.
                                    8 I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices
                                        or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
                                    9 I have no need of a bull from your stall
                                        or of goats from your pens,
                                    10 for every animal of the forest is mine,
                                        and the cattle on a thousand hills.
                                    11 I know every bird in the mountains,
                                        and the insects in the fields are mine.
                                    12 If I were hungry I would not tell you,
                                        for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
                                    13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls
                                        or drink the blood of goats?

                                    14 “Sacrifice thank offerings to God,
                                        fulfill your vows to the Most High,
                                    15 and call on me in the day of trouble;
                                        I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”

                                    16 But to the wicked person, God says:

                                    “What right have you to recite my laws
                                        or take my covenant on your lips?
                                    17 You hate my instruction
                                        and cast my words behind you.
                                    18 When you see a thief, you join with him;
                                        you throw in your lot with adulterers.
                                    19 You use your mouth for evil
                                        and harness your tongue to deceit.
                                    20 You sit and testify against your brother
                                        and slander your own mother’s son.
                                    21 When you did these things and I kept silent,
                                        you thought I was exactly like you.
                                    But I now arraign you
                                        and set my accusations before you.

                                    22 “Consider this, you who forget God,
                                        or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:
                                    23 Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me,
                                        and to the blameless I will show my salvation.”

                                       For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.
                                  1 Have mercy on me, O God,
                                      according to your unfailing love;
                                  according to your great compassion
                                      blot out my transgressions.
                                  2 Wash away all my iniquity
                                      and cleanse me from my sin.

                                  3 For I know my transgressions,
                                      and my sin is always before me.
                                  4 Against you, you only, have I sinned
                                      and done what is evil in your sight;
                                  so you are right in your verdict
                                      and justified when you judge.
                                  5 Surely I was sinful at birth,
                                      sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
                                  6 Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;
                                      you taught me wisdom in that secret place.

                                  7 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
                                      wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
                                  8 Let me hear joy and gladness;
                                      let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
                                  9 Hide your face from my sins
                                      and blot out all my iniquity.

                                  10 Create in me a pure heart, O God,
                                      and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
                                  11 Do not cast me from your presence
                                      or take your Holy Spirit from me.
                                  12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation
                                      and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.

                                  13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
                                      so that sinners will turn back to you.
                                  14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,
                                      you who are God my Savior,
                                      and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
                                  15 Open my lips, Lord,
                                      and my mouth will declare your praise.
                                  16 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
                                      you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
                                  17 My sacrifice, O God, is[b] a broken spirit;
                                      a broken and contrite heart
                                      you, God, will not despise.

                                  18 May it please you to prosper Zion,
                                      to build up the walls of Jerusalem.
                                  19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous,
                                      in burnt offerings offered whole;
                                      then bulls will be offered on your altar.

                                1 Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero?
                                    Why do you boast all day long,
                                    you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
                                2 You who practice deceit,
                                    your tongue plots destruction;
                                    it is like a sharpened razor.
                                3 You love evil rather than good,
                                    falsehood rather than speaking the truth.[c]
                                4 You love every harmful word,
                                    you deceitful tongue!

                                5 Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin:
                                    He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent;
                                    he will uproot you from the land of the living.
                                6 The righteous will see and fear;
                                    they will laugh at you, saying,
                                7 “Here now is the man
                                    who did not make God his stronghold
                                but trusted in his great wealth
                                    and grew strong by destroying others!”

                                8 But I am like an olive tree
                                    flourishing in the house of God;
                                I trust in God’s unfailing love
                                    for ever and ever.
                                9 For what you have done I will always praise you
                                    in the presence of your faithful people.
                                And I will hope in your name,

                                      1 The fool says in his heart,
                                          “There is no God.”
                                      They are corrupt, and their ways are vile;
                                          there is no one who does good.

                                      2 God looks down from heaven
                                          on all mankind
                                      to see if there are any who understand,
                                          any who seek God.
                                      3 Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt;
                                          there is no one who does good,
                                          not even one.

                                      4 Do all these evildoers know nothing?

                                      They devour my people as though eating bread;
                                          they never call on God.
                                      5 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread,
                                          where there was nothing to dread.
                                      God scattered the bones of those who attacked you;
                                          you put them to shame, for God despised them.

                                      1 Save me, O God, by your name;
                                          vindicate me by your might.
                                      2 Hear my prayer, O God;
                                          listen to the words of my mouth.

                                      3 Arrogant foes are attacking me;
                                          ruthless people are trying to kill me—
                                          people without regard for God.[c]

                                      4 Surely God is my help;
                                          the Lord is the one who sustains me.

                                      5 Let evil recoil on those who slander me;
                                          in your faithfulness destroy them.

                                      6 I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you;
                                          I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.
                                      7 You have delivered me from all my troubles,
                                          and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.

                                          1 Listen to my prayer, O God,
                                              do not ignore my plea;
                                          2     hear me and answer me.
                                          My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
                                          3     because of what my enemy is saying,
                                              because of the threats of the wicked;
                                          for they bring down suffering on me
                                              and assail me in their anger.

                                          4 My heart is in anguish within me;
                                              the terrors of death have fallen on me.
                                          5 Fear and trembling have beset me;
                                              horror has overwhelmed me.
                                          6 I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove!
                                              I would fly away and be at rest.
                                          7 I would flee far away
                                              and stay in the desert;[c]
                                          8 I would hurry to my place of shelter,
                                              far from the tempest and storm.”

                                          9 Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words,
                                              for I see violence and strife in the city.
                                          10 Day and night they prowl about on its walls;
                                              malice and abuse are within it.
                                          11 Destructive forces are at work in the city;
                                              threats and lies never leave its streets.

                                          12 If an enemy were insulting me,
                                              I could endure it;
                                          if a foe were rising against me,
                                              I could hide.
                                          13 But it is you, a man like myself,
                                              my companion, my close friend,
                                          14 with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship
                                              at the house of God,
                                          as we walked about
                                              among the worshipers.

                                          15 Let death take my enemies by surprise;
                                              let them go down alive to the realm of the dead,
                                              for evil finds lodging among them.

                                          16 As for me, I call to God,
                                              and the Lord saves me.
                                          17 Evening, morning and noon
                                              I cry out in distress,
                                              and he hears my voice.
                                          18 He rescues me unharmed
                                              from the battle waged against me,
                                              even though many oppose me.
                                          19 God, who is enthroned from of old,
                                              who does not change—
                                          he will hear them and humble them,
                                              because they have no fear of God.

                                          20 My companion attacks his friends;
                                              he violates his covenant.
                                          21 His talk is smooth as butter,
                                              yet war is in his heart;
                                          his words are more soothing than oil,
                                              yet they are drawn swords.

                                          22 Cast your cares on the Lord
                                              and he will sustain you;
                                          he will never let
                                              the righteous be shaken.
                                          23 But you, God, will bring down the wicked
                                              into the pit of decay;
                                          the bloodthirsty and deceitful
                                              will not live out half their days.

                                          But as for me, I trust in you.

                                        1 Be merciful to me, my God,
                                            for my enemies are in hot pursuit;
                                            all day long they press their attack.
                                        2 My adversaries pursue me all day long;
                                            in their pride many are attacking me.

                                        3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
                                        4     In God, whose word I praise—
                                        in God I trust and am not afraid.
                                            What can mere mortals do to me?

                                        5 All day long they twist my words;
                                            all their schemes are for my ruin.
                                        6 They conspire, they lurk,
                                            they watch my steps,
                                            hoping to take my life.
                                        7 Because of their wickedness do not[c] let them escape;
                                            in your anger, God, bring the nations down.

                                        8 Record my misery;
                                            list my tears on your scroll[d]—
                                            are they not in your record?
                                        9 Then my enemies will turn back
                                            when I call for help.
                                            By this I will know that God is for me.

                                        10 In God, whose word I praise,
                                            in the Lord, whose word I praise—

                                        12 I am under vows to you, my God;
                                            I will present my thank offerings to you.
                                        13 For you have delivered me from death
                                            and my feet from stumbling,
                                        that I may walk before God

                                            1 Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me,
                                                for in you I take refuge.

                                            2 I cry out to God Most High,
                                                to God, who vindicates me.
                                            3 He sends from heaven and saves me,

                                                whose tongues are sharp swords.

                                            5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
                                                let your glory be over all the earth.

                                                I was bowed down in distress.
                                            They dug a pit in my path—
                                                but they have fallen into it themselves.

                                            7 My heart, O God, is steadfast,
                                                my heart is steadfast;
                                                I will sing and make music.
                                            8 Awake, my soul!
                                                Awake, harp and lyre!
                                                I will awaken the dawn.

                                            9 I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
                                                I will sing of you among the peoples.
                                            10 For great is your love, reaching to the heavens;
                                                your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

                                            11 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
                                                let your glory be over all the earth.

                                       For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam.
                                          1 Do you rulers indeed speak justly?
                                              Do you judge people with equity?
                                          2 No, in your heart you devise injustice,
                                              and your hands mete out violence on the earth.

                                          3 Even from birth the wicked go astray;
                                              from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies.
                                          4 Their venom is like the venom of a snake,
                                              like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,
                                          5 that will not heed the tune of the charmer,
                                              however skillful the enchanter may be.

                                          6 Break the teeth in their mouths, O God;
                                              Lord, tear out the fangs of those lions!
                                          7 Let them vanish like water that flows away;
                                              when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short.
                                          8 May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along,
                                              like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.

                                          9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns—
                                              whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.
                                          10 The righteous will be glad when they are avenged,
                                              when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.
                                          11 Then people will say,
                                              “Surely the righteous still are rewarded;
                                              surely there is a God who judges the earth.”

                                            1 Deliver me from my enemies, O God;
                                                be my fortress against those who are attacking me.
                                            2 Deliver me from evildoers
                                                and save me from those who are after my blood.

                                            3 See how they lie in wait for me!
                                                Fierce men conspire against me
                                                for no offense or sin of mine, Lord.
                                            4 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
                                                Arise to help me; look on my plight!
                                            5 You, Lord God Almighty,
                                                you who are the God of Israel,
                                            rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
                                                show no mercy to wicked traitors.[c]

                                            6 They return at evening,
                                                snarling like dogs,
                                                and prowl about the city.
                                            7 See what they spew from their mouths—
                                                the words from their lips are sharp as swords,
                                                and they think, “Who can hear us?”
                                            8 But you laugh at them, Lord;
                                                you scoff at all those nations.

                                            9 You are my strength, I watch for you;
                                                you, God, are my fortress,

                                            God will go before me
                                                and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
                                            11 But do not kill them, Lord our shield,[d]
                                                or my people will forget.
                                            In your might uproot them
                                                and bring them down.
                                            12 For the sins of their mouths,
                                                for the words of their lips,
                                                let them be caught in their pride.
                                            For the curses and lies they utter,
                                            13     consume them in your wrath,
                                                consume them till they are no more.
                                            Then it will be known to the ends of the earth
                                                that God rules over Jacob.

                                            14 They return at evening,
                                                snarling like dogs,
                                                and prowl about the city.
                                            15 They wander about for food
                                                and howl if not satisfied.
                                            16 But I will sing of your strength,
                                                in the morning I will sing of your love;
                                            for you are my fortress,
                                                my refuge in times of trouble.

                                            17 You are my strength, I sing praise to you;
                                                you, God, are my fortress,
                                                my God on whom I can rely.

                                          1 You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us;
                                              you have been angry—now restore us!
                                          2 You have shaken the land and torn it open;
                                              mend its fractures, for it is quaking.
                                          3 You have shown your people desperate times;
                                              you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
                                          4 But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner
                                              to be unfurled against the bow.

                                          5 Save us and help us with your right hand,

                                              and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.

                                              Judah is my scepter.
                                          8 Moab is my washbasin,
                                              on Edom I toss my sandal;
                                              over Philistia I shout in triumph.”

                                            5 For you, God, have heard my vows;
                                                you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

                                            6 Increase the days of the king’s life,
                                                his years for many generations.
                                            7 May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever;
                                                appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.

                                            8 Then I will ever sing in praise of your name
                                                and fulfill my vows day after day.

                                      <p>
                                       For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
                                              1 Truly my soul finds rest in God;
                                                  my salvation comes from him.
                                              2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
                                                  he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.

                                              3 How long will you assault me?
                                                  Would all of you throw me down—
                                                  this leaning wall, this tottering fence?
                                              4 Surely they intend to topple me
                                                  from my lofty place;
                                                  they take delight in lies.
                                              With their mouths they bless,
                                                  but in their hearts they curse.

                                              5 Yes, my soul, find rest in God;
                                                  my hope comes from him.
                                              6 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
                                                  he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
                                              7 My salvation and my honor depend on God;
                                                  he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
                                              8 Trust in him at all times, you people;
                                                  pour out your hearts to him,
                                                  for God is our refuge.

                                              9 Surely the lowborn are but a breath,
                                                  the highborn are but a lie.
                                              If weighed on a balance, they are nothing;
                                                  together they are only a breath.
                                              10 Do not trust in extortion
                                                  or put vain hope in stolen goods;
                                              though your riches increase,
                                                  do not set your heart on them.

                                              11 One thing God has spoken,
                                                  two things I have heard:
                                              “Power belongs to you, God,
                                              12     and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”;
                                              and, “You reward everyone
                                                  according to what they have done.”

                                       A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah.
                                          1 You, God, are my God,
                                              earnestly I seek you;
                                          I thirst for you,
                                              my whole being longs for you,
                                          in a dry and parched land
                                              where there is no water.

                                          2 I have seen you in the sanctuary
                                              and beheld your power and your glory.
                                          3 Because your love is better than life,
                                              my lips will glorify you.
                                          4 I will praise you as long as I live,
                                              and in your name I will lift up my hands.
                                          5 I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods;
                                              with singing lips my mouth will praise you.

                                          6 On my bed I remember you;
                                              I think of you through the watches of the night.
                                          7 Because you are my help,
                                              I sing in the shadow of your wings.
                                          8 I cling to you;
                                              your right hand upholds me.

                                          9 Those who want to kill me will be destroyed;
                                              they will go down to the depths of the earth.
                                          10 They will be given over to the sword
                                              and become food for jackals.

                                          11 But the king will rejoice in God;
                                              all who swear by God will glory in him,
                                              while the mouths of liars will be silenced.

                                       For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                                            1 Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint;
                                                protect my life from the threat of the enemy.

                                            2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,
                                                from the plots of evildoers.
                                            3 They sharpen their tongues like swords
                                                and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
                                            4 They shoot from ambush at the innocent;
                                                they shoot suddenly, without fear.

                                            5 They encourage each other in evil plans,
                                                they talk about hiding their snares;
                                                they say, “Who will see it[b]?”
                                            6 They plot injustice and say,
                                                “We have devised a perfect plan!”
                                                Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.

                                            7 But God will shoot them with his arrows;
                                                they will suddenly be struck down.
                                            8 He will turn their own tongues against them
                                                and bring them to ruin;
                                                all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
                                            9 All people will fear;
                                                they will proclaim the works of God
                                                and ponder what he has done.

                                            10 The righteous will rejoice in the Lord
                                                and take refuge in him;
                                                all the upright in heart will glory in him!

                                              11 You crown the year with your bounty,
                                                  and your carts overflow with abundance.
                                              12 The grasslands of the wilderness overflow;
                                                  the hills are clothed with gladness.
                                              13 The meadows are covered with flocks
                                                  and the valleys are mantled with grain;

                                       For the director of music. A song. A psalm.
                                        1 Shout for joy to God, all the earth!
                                        2     Sing the glory of his name;
                                            make his praise glorious.
                                        3 Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
                                            So great is your power
                                            that your enemies cringe before you.
                                        4 All the earth bows down to you;
                                            they sing praise to you,
                                            they sing the praises of your name.”[a]

                                        5 Come and see what God has done,
                                            his awesome deeds for mankind!
                                        6 He turned the sea into dry land,
                                            they passed through the waters on foot—
                                            come, let us rejoice in him.
                                        7 He rules forever by his power,
                                            his eyes watch the nations—
                                            let not the rebellious rise up against him.

                                        8 Praise our God, all peoples,
                                            let the sound of his praise be heard;
                                        9 he has preserved our lives
                                            and kept our feet from slipping.
                                        10 For you, God, tested us;
                                            you refined us like silver.
                                        11 You brought us into prison
                                            and laid burdens on our backs.
                                        12 You let people ride over our heads;
                                            we went through fire and water,
                                            but you brought us to a place of abundance.

                                        13 I will come to your temple with burnt offerings
                                            and fulfill my vows to you—
                                        14 vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke
                                            when I was in trouble.
                                        15 I will sacrifice fat animals to you
                                            and an offering of rams;
                                            I will offer bulls and goats.

                                        16 Come and hear, all you who fear God;
                                            let me tell you what he has done for me.
                                        17 I cried out to him with my mouth;
                                            his praise was on my tongue.
                                        18 If I had cherished sin in my heart,
                                            the Lord would not have listened;
                                        19 but God has surely listened
                                            and has heard my prayer.
                                        20 Praise be to God,
                                            who has not rejected my prayer
                                            or withheld his love from me!

                                                      when you marched through the wilderness,

                                                  10 Your people settled in it,
                                                      and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.

                                                      and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng:

                                                      its feathers with shining gold.”

                                                      you took many captives;
                                                      you received gifts from people,
                                                  even from the rebellious—
                                                      that you, Lord God, might dwell there.

                                                  19 Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior,
                                                      who daily bears our burdens.
                                                  20 Our God is a God who saves;
                                                      from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death.
                                                  21 Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies,
                                                      the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.
                                                  22 The Lord says, “I will bring them from Bashan;
                                                      I will bring them from the depths of the sea,
                                                  23 that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes,
                                                      while the tongues of your dogs have their share.”

                                                  24 Your procession, God, has come into view,
                                                      the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
                                                  25 In front are the singers, after them the musicians;
                                                      with them are the young women playing the timbrels.
                                                  26 Praise God in the great congregation;
                                                      praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
                                                  27 There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them,
                                                      there the great throng of Judah’s princes,
                                                      and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.

                                                  28 Summon your power, God;
                                                      show us your strength, our God, as you have done before.
                                                  29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem
                                                      kings will bring you gifts.
                                                  30 Rebuke the beast among the reeds,
                                                      the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.
                                                  Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver.
                                                      Scatter the nations who delight in war.
                                                  31 Envoys will come from Egypt;
                                                      Cush[k] will submit herself to God.

                                                  32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth,
                                                      sing praise to the Lord,
                                                  33 to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens,
                                                      who thunders with mighty voice.
                                                  34 Proclaim the power of God,
                                                      whose majesty is over Israel,
                                                      whose power is in the heavens.
                                                  35 You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary;
                                                      the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.

                                                  Praise be to God!

                                       For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.
                                            1 Save me, O God,
                                                for the waters have come up to my neck.
                                            2 I sink in the miry depths,
                                                where there is no foothold.
                                            I have come into the deep waters;
                                                the floods engulf me.
                                            3 I am worn out calling for help;
                                                my throat is parched.
                                            My eyes fail,
                                                looking for my God.
                                            4 Those who hate me without reason
                                                outnumber the hairs of my head;
                                            many are my enemies without cause,
                                                those who seek to destroy me.
                                            I am forced to restore
                                                what I did not steal.

                                            5 You, God, know my folly;
                                                my guilt is not hidden from you.

                                            6 Lord, the Lord Almighty,
                                                may those who hope in you
                                                not be disgraced because of me;
                                            God of Israel,
                                                may those who seek you
                                                not be put to shame because of me.
                                            7 For I endure scorn for your sake,
                                                and shame covers my face.
                                            8 I am a foreigner to my own family,
                                                a stranger to my own mother’s children;
                                            9 for zeal for your house consumes me,
                                                and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
                                            10 When I weep and fast,
                                                I must endure scorn;
                                            11 when I put on sackcloth,
                                                people make sport of me.
                                            12 Those who sit at the gate mock me,
                                                and I am the song of the drunkards.

                                            13 But I pray to you, Lord,
                                                in the time of your favor;
                                            in your great love, O God,
                                                answer me with your sure salvation.
                                            14 Rescue me from the mire,
                                                do not let me sink;
                                            deliver me from those who hate me,
                                                from the deep waters.
                                            15 Do not let the floodwaters engulf me
                                                or the depths swallow me up
                                                or the pit close its mouth over me.

                                            16 Answer me, Lord, out of the goodness of your love;
                                                in your great mercy turn to me.
                                            17 Do not hide your face from your servant;
                                                answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.
                                            18 Come near and rescue me;
                                                deliver me because of my foes.

                                            19 You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed;
                                                all my enemies are before you.
                                            20 Scorn has broken my heart
                                                and has left me helpless;
                                            I looked for sympathy, but there was none,
                                                for comforters, but I found none.
                                            21 They put gall in my food
                                                and gave me vinegar for my thirst.

                                            22 May the table set before them become a snare;
                                                may it become retribution and[b] a trap.
                                            23 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,
                                                and their backs be bent forever.
                                            24 Pour out your wrath on them;
                                                let your fierce anger overtake them.
                                            25 May their place be deserted;
                                                let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
                                            26 For they persecute those you wound
                                                and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
                                            27 Charge them with crime upon crime;
                                                do not let them share in your salvation.
                                            28 May they be blotted out of the book of life
                                                and not be listed with the righteous.

                                            29 But as for me, afflicted and in pain—
                                                may your salvation, God, protect me.

                                            30 I will praise God’s name in song
                                                and glorify him with thanksgiving.
                                            31 This will please the Lord more than an ox,
                                                more than a bull with its horns and hooves.
                                            32 The poor will see and be glad—
                                                you who seek God, may your hearts live!
                                            33 The Lord hears the needy
                                                and does not despise his captive people.

                                            34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
                                                the seas and all that move in them,
                                            35 for God will save Zion
                                                and rebuild the cities of Judah.
                                            Then people will settle there and possess it;
                                            36     the children of his servants will inherit it,
                                                and those who love his name will dwell there.

                                                    rejoice and be glad in you;
                                                may those who long for your saving help always say,
                                                    “The Lord is great!”

                                                5 But as for me, I am poor and needy;
                                                    come quickly to me, O God.
                                                You are my help and my deliverer;
                                                    Lord, do not delay.

                                       In you, Lord, I have taken refuge;
                                                      let me never be put to shame.

                                                      turn your ear to me and save me.
                                                  3 Be my rock of refuge,
                                                      to which I can always go;
                                                  give the command to save me,
                                                      for you are my rock and my fortress.
                                                  4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
                                                      from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.

                                                  5 For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord,
                                                      my confidence since my youth.
                                                  6 From birth I have relied on you;
                                                      you brought me forth from my mother’s womb.
                                                      I will ever praise you.
                                                  7 I have become a sign to many;
                                                      you are my strong refuge.
                                                  8 My mouth is filled with your praise,
                                                      declaring your splendor all day long.

                                                  9 Do not cast me away when I am old;
                                                      do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
                                                  10 For my enemies speak against me;
                                                      those who wait to kill me conspire together.
                                                  11 They say, “God has forsaken him;
                                                      pursue him and seize him,
                                                      for no one will rescue him.”
                                                  12 Do not be far from me, my God;
                                                      come quickly, God, to help me.
                                                  13 May my accusers perish in shame;
                                                      may those who want to harm me
                                                      be covered with scorn and disgrace.

                                                  14 As for me, I will always have hope;
                                                      I will praise you more and more.

                                                  15 My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds,
                                                      of your saving acts all day long—
                                                      though I know not how to relate them all.
                                                  16 I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord;
                                                      I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.
                                                  17 Since my youth, God, you have taught me,
                                                      and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
                                                  18 Even when I am old and gray,
                                                      do not forsake me, my God,
                                                  till I declare your power to the next generation,
                                                      your mighty acts to all who are to come.

                                                  19 Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens,
                                                      you who have done great things.
                                                      Who is like you, God?
                                                  20 Though you have made me see troubles,
                                                      many and bitter,
                                                      you will restore my life again;
                                                  from the depths of the earth
                                                      you will again bring me up.
                                                  21 You will increase my honor
                                                      and comfort me once more.

                                                  22 I will praise you with the harp
                                                      for your faithfulness, my God;
                                                  I will sing praise to you with the lyre,
                                                      Holy One of Israel.
                                                  23 My lips will shout for joy
                                                      when I sing praise to you—
                                                      I whom you have delivered.
                                                  24 My tongue will tell of your righteous acts
                                                      all day long,
                                                  for those who wanted to harm me
                                                      have been put to shame and confusion.

                                                        and from the River to the ends of the earth.
                                                    9 May the desert tribes bow before him
                                                        and his enemies lick the dust.

                                                        and all nations serve him.

                                                    12 For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
                                                        the afflicted who have no one to help.
                                                    13 He will take pity on the weak and the needy
                                                        and save the needy from death.
                                                    14 He will rescue them from oppression and violence,
                                                        for precious is their blood in his sight.

                                                    15 Long may he live!

                                                        and bless him all day long.
                                                    16 May grain abound throughout the land;
                                                        on the tops of the hills may it sway.
                                                    May the crops flourish like Lebanon
                                                        and thrive like the grass of the field.
                                                    17 May his name endure forever;
                                                        may it continue as long as the sun.

                                                    Then all nations will be blessed through him,
                                                        and they will call him blessed.

                                                    18 Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel,
                                                        who alone does marvelous deeds.
                                                    19 Praise be to his glorious name forever;
                                                        may the whole earth be filled with his glory.

                              <h2 className={styles.chapter}>PSALM 73</h2>
                                      <p>
                                       A psalm of Asaph.
                                            1 Surely God is good to Israel,
                                                to those who are pure in heart.

                                            2 But as for me, my feet had almost slipped;
                                                I had nearly lost my foothold.
                                            3 For I envied the arrogant
                                                when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

                                            4 They have no struggles;
                                                their bodies are healthy and strong.
                                            5 They are free from common human burdens;
                                                they are not plagued by human ills.
                                            6 Therefore pride is their necklace;
                                                they clothe themselves with violence.
                                            7 From their callous hearts comes iniquity;
                                                their evil imaginations have no limits.
                                            8 They scoff, and speak with malice;
                                                with arrogance they threaten oppression.
                                            9 Their mouths lay claim to heaven,
                                                and their tongues take possession of the earth.
                                            10 Therefore their people turn to them
                                                and drink up waters in abundance.
                                            11 They say, “How would God know?
                                                Does the Most High know anything?”

                                            12 This is what the wicked are like—
                                                always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.

                                            13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure
                                                and have washed my hands in innocence.
                                            14 All day long I have been afflicted,
                                                and every morning brings new punishments.

                                            15 If I had spoken out like that,
                                                I would have betrayed your children.
                                            16 When I tried to understand all this,
                                                it troubled me deeply
                                            17 till I entered the sanctuary of God;
                                                then I understood their final destiny.

                                            18 Surely you place them on slippery ground;
                                                you cast them down to ruin.
                                            19 How suddenly are they destroyed,
                                                completely swept away by terrors!
                                            20 They are like a dream when one awakes;
                                                when you arise, Lord,
                                                you will despise them as fantasies.

                                            21 When my heart was grieved
                                                and my spirit embittered,
                                            22 I was senseless and ignorant;
                                                I was a brute beast before you.

                                            23 Yet I am always with you;
                                                you hold me by my right hand.
                                            24 You guide me with your counsel,
                                                and afterward you will take me into glory.
                                            25 Whom have I in heaven but you?
                                                And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
                                            26 My flesh and my heart may fail,
                                                but God is the strength of my heart
                                                and my portion forever.

                                            27 Those who are far from you will perish;
                                                you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
                                            28 But as for me, it is good to be near God.
                                                I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge;
                                                I will tell of all your deeds.
                                      </p>

                                       A maski of Asaph.
                                            1 O God, why have you rejected us forever?
                                                Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
                                            2 Remember the nation you purchased long ago,
                                                the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed—
                                                Mount Zion, where you dwelt.
                                            3 Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins,
                                                all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.

                                            4 Your foes roared in the place where you met with us;
                                                they set up their standards as signs.
                                            5 They behaved like men wielding axes
                                                to cut through a thicket of trees.
                                            6 They smashed all the carved paneling
                                                with their axes and hatchets.
                                            7 They burned your sanctuary to the ground;
                                                they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
                                            8 They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!”
                                                They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.

                                            9 We are given no signs from God;
                                                no prophets are left,
                                                and none of us knows how long this will be.
                                            10 How long will the enemy mock you, God?
                                                Will the foe revile your name forever?
                                            11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
                                                Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!

                                            12 But God is my King from long ago;
                                                he brings salvation on the earth.

                                            13 It was you who split open the sea by your power;
                                                you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
                                            14 It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan
                                                and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.
                                            15 It was you who opened up springs and streams;
                                                you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
                                            16 The day is yours, and yours also the night;
                                                you established the sun and moon.
                                            17 It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth;
                                                you made both summer and winter.

                                            18 Remember how the enemy has mocked you, Lord,
                                                how foolish people have reviled your name.
                                            19 Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts;
                                                do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
                                            20 Have regard for your covenant,
                                                because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
                                            21 Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace;
                                                may the poor and needy praise your name.
                                            22 Rise up, O God, and defend your cause;
                                                remember how fools mock you all day long.
                                            23 Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries,
                                                the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.
