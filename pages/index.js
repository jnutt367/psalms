            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                          Blessed is the one
                              who does not walk in step with the wicked
                          or stand in the way that sinners take
                              or sit in the company of mockers,
                           but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
                              and who meditates on his law day and night.
                           That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
                              which yields its fruit in season
                          and whose leaf does not wither—
                              whatever they do prospers.
                              Not so the wicked!
                              They are like chaff
                              that the wind blows away.
                              Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
                              nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
                              For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
                              but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.

                  <p>
                                        ( A Psalm of David )
                           Why do the nations conspire[a]
                              and the peoples plot in vain?
                           The kings of the earth rise up
                              and the rulers band together
                              against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
                           “Let us break their chains
                              and throw off their shackles.”

                           The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
                              the Lord scoffs at them.
                           He rebukes them in his anger
                              and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,
                           “I have installed my king
                              on Zion, my holy mountain.”

                           I will proclaim the Lord’s decree:

                          He said to me, “You are my son;
                              today I have become your father.
                           Ask me,
                              and I will make the nations your inheritance,
                              the ends of the earth your possession.
                           You will break them with a rod of iron;
                              you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”

                           Therefore, you kings, be wise;
                              be warned, you rulers of the earth.
                           Serve the Lord with fear
                              and celebrate his rule with trembling.
                           Kiss his son, or he will be angry
                              and your way will lead to your destruction,
                          for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
                              Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

                            (when he fled from his son Absolam)
                            Lord, how many are my foes!
                                How many rise up against me!
                             Many are saying of me,

                             But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
                                my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
                             I call out to the Lord,
                                and he answers me from his holy mountain.

                             I lie down and sleep;
                                I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
                             I will not fear though tens of thousands
                                assail me on every side.

                             Arise, Lord!
                                Deliver me, my God!
                            Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
                                break the teeth of the wicked.

                             From the Lord comes deliverance.
                                May your blessing be on your people.

                             Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?”
                                Let the light of your face shine on us.
                             Fill my heart with joy
                                when their grain and new wine abound.

                             In peace I will lie down and sleep,

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                For the director of music. For pipes. A psalm of David.
 Listen to my words, Lord,
    consider my lament.
 Hear my cry for help,
    my King and my God,
    for to you I pray.

 In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
    in the morning I lay my requests before you
    and wait expectantly.
 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness;
    with you, evil people are not welcome.
 The arrogant cannot stand
    in your presence.
You hate all who do wrong;
     you destroy those who tell lies.
The bloodthirsty and deceitful
    you, Lord, detest.
 But I, by your great love,
    can come into your house;
in reverence I bow down
    toward your holy temple.

 Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness
    because of my enemies—
    make your way straight before me.
 Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;
    their heart is filled with malice.
Their throat is an open grave;
    with their tongues they tell lies.
 Declare them guilty, O God!
    Let their intrigues be their downfall.
Banish them for their many sins,
    for they have rebelled against you.
 But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    let them ever sing for joy.
Spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may rejoice in you.

 Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
    you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

              For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to sheminith.
 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger
    or discipline me in your wrath.
 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint;
    heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
 My soul is in deep anguish.
    How long, Lord, how long?

 Turn, Lord, and deliver me;
    save me because of your unfailing love.
 Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
    Who praises you from the grave?

 I am worn out from my groaning.

All night long I flood my bed with weeping
    and drench my couch with tears.
    My eyes grow weak with sorrow;
    they fail because of all my foes.

 Away from me, all you who do evil,
    for the Lord has heard my weeping.
 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy;
    the Lord accepts my prayer.
 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish;
    they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.

            which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.
 Lord my God, I take refuge in you;
    save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
 or they will tear me apart like a lion
    and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.

 Lord my God, if I have done this
    and there is guilt on my hands—
 if I have repaid my ally with evil
    or without cause have robbed my foe—
 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me;
    let him trample my life to the ground
    and make me sleep in the dust.[c]

 Arise, Lord, in your anger;
    rise up against the rage of my enemies.
    Awake, my God; decree justice.
 Let the assembled peoples gather around you,
    while you sit enthroned over them on high.
     Let the Lord judge the peoples.
Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness,
    according to my integrity, O Most High.
 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked
    and make the righteous secure—
you, the righteous God
    who probes minds and hearts.

 My shield is God Most High,
    who saves the upright in heart.
 God is a righteous judge,
    a God who displays his wrath every day.
 If he does not relent,
    he will sharpen his sword;
    he will bend and string his bow.
 He has prepared his deadly weapons;
    he makes ready his flaming arrows.

 Whoever is pregnant with evil
    conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
 Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out
    falls into the pit they have made.
 The trouble they cause recoils on them;
    their violence comes down on their own heads.

 I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness;
    I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.

 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!

You have set your glory
    in the heavens.
 Through the praise of children and infants
    you have established a stronghold against your enemies,
    to silence the foe and the avenger.
 When I consider your heavens,
    the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars,
    which you have set in place,
 what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
    human beings that you care for them?
 You have made them a little lower than the angels
    and crowned them with glory and honor.
 You made them rulers over the works of your hands;
    you put everything under their feet:
 all flocks and herds,
    and the animals of the wild,
 the birds in the sky,
    and the fish in the sea,
    all that swim the paths of the seas.

 Lord, our Lord,
    how majestic is your name in all the earth!"

            <p>( A Psalm of David )
                  For the director of music. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A psalm of David.
 I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart;
    I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
    I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.

 My enemies turn back;
    they stumble and perish before you.
 For you have upheld my right and my cause,
    sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
    you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
 Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies,
    you have uprooted their cities;
    even the memory of them has perished.

 The Lord reigns forever;
    he has established his throne for judgment.
 He rules the world in righteousness
    and judges the peoples with equity.
 The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed,
    a stronghold in times of trouble.
  Those who know your name trust in you,
    for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.

 Sing the praises of the Lord, enthroned in Zion;
    proclaim among the nations what he has done.
 For he who avenges blood remembers;
    he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.

 Lord, see how my enemies persecute me!
    Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
 that I may declare your praises
    in the gates of Daughter Zion,
    and there rejoice in your salvation.

 The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug;
    their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
 The Lord is known by his acts of justice;
    the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.[c]
 The wicked go down to the realm of the dead,
    all the nations that forget God.
 But God will never forget the needy;
    the hope of the afflicted will never perish.

 Arise, Lord, do not let mortals triumph;
    let the nations be judged in your presence.
Strike them with terror, Lord;
    let the nations know they are only mortal.

            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>PSALM 10 &darr;</h2>
            <p>
              Why, Lord, do you stand far off?
    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

 In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,
    who are caught in the schemes he devises.
 He boasts about the cravings of his heart;
    he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.
 In his pride the wicked man does not seek him;
    in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
 His ways are always prosperous;
    your laws are rejected by[b] him;
    he sneers at all his enemies.
 He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.”
    He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”

 His mouth is full of lies and threats;
    trouble and evil are under his tongue.
 He lies in wait near the villages;
    from ambush he murders the innocent.
His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
     like a lion in cover he lies in wait.
He lies in wait to catch the helpless;
    he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
 His victims are crushed, they collapse;
    they fall under his strength.
 He says to himself, “God will never notice;
    he covers his face and never sees.”

 Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God.
    Do not forget the helpless.
 Why does the wicked man revile God?
    Why does he say to himself,
    “He won’t call me to account”?
 But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted;
    you consider their grief and take it in hand.
The victims commit themselves to you;
    you are the helper of the fatherless.
 Break the arm of the wicked man;
    call the evildoer to account for his wickedness
    that would not otherwise be found out.

 The Lord is King for ever and ever;
    the nations will perish from his land.
 You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted;
    you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
 defending the fatherless and the oppressed,
    so that mere earthly mortals
    will never again strike terror.

 PSALM 11</h2>
<p>
For the director of music. Of David.
1 In the Lord I take refuge.
    How then can you say to me:
    “Flee like a bird to your mountain.
2 For look, the wicked bend their bows;
    they set their arrows against the strings
to shoot from the shadows
    at the upright in heart.
3 When the foundations are being destroyed,
    what can the righteous do?”

4 The Lord is in his holy temple;
    the Lord is on his heavenly throne.
He observes everyone on earth;
    his eyes examine them.
5 The Lord examines the righteous,
    but the wicked, those who love violence,
    he hates with a passion.
6 On the wicked he will rain
    fiery coals and burning sulfur;
    a scorching wind will be their lot.

7 For the Lord is righteous,
    he loves justice;
    the upright will see his face.

      PSALM 12</h2>
              <p>
              For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
              1 Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;
                  those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
              2 Everyone lies to their neighbor;
                  they flatter with their lips
                  but harbor deception in their hearts.

              3 May the Lord silence all flattering lips
                  and every boastful tongue—
              4 those who say,
                  “By our tongues we will prevail;
                  our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”

              5 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
                  I will now arise,” says the Lord.
                  “I will protect them from those who malign them.”
              6 And the words of the Lord are flawless,
                  like silver purified in a crucible,
                  like gold refined seven times.

              7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe
                  and will protect us forever from the wicked,
              8 who freely strut about
                  when what is vile is honored by the human race.

      PSALM 13</h2>
                <p>
        For the director of music. A psalm of David.
        1 How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?
            How long will you hide your face from me?
        2 How long must I wrestle with my thoughts
            and day after day have sorrow in my heart?
            How long will my enemy triumph over me?

        3 Look on me and answer, Lord my God.
            Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death,
        4 and my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,”
            and my foes will rejoice when I fall.

        5 But I trust in your unfailing love;
            my heart rejoices in your salvation.
        6 I will sing the Lord’s praise,
            for he has been good to me.

            <p>
            For the director of music. Of David.
            1 The fool[a] says in his heart,
                “There is no God.”
            They are corrupt, their deeds are vile;
                there is no one who does good.

            2 The Lord looks down from heaven
                on all mankind
            to see if there are any who understand,
                any who seek God.
            3 All have turned away, all have become corrupt;
                there is no one who does good,
                not even one.

            4 Do all these evildoers know nothing?

            They devour my people as though eating bread;
                they never call on the Lord.
            5 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread,
                for God is present in the company of the righteous.
            6 You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor,
                but the Lord is their refuge.

            7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
                When the Lord restores his people,
                let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

1 Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent?

2 The one whose walk is blameless,
    who does what is righteous,
    who speaks the truth from their heart;
3 whose tongue utters no slander,
    who does no wrong to a neighbor,
    and casts no slur on others;
4 who despises a vile person
    but honors those who fear the Lord;
who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
    and does not change their mind;
5 who lends money to the poor without interest;
    who does not accept a bribe against the innocent.

Whoever does these things

1 Keep me safe, my God,
    for in you I take refuge.

2 I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord;
    apart from you I have no good thing.”
3 I say of the holy people who are in the land,
    “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.”
4 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.
    I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods
    or take up their names on my lips.

5 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup;
    you make my lot secure.
6 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
    surely I have a delightful inheritance.
7 I will praise the Lord, who counsels me;
    even at night my heart instructs me.
8 I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
    With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

9 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
    my body also will rest secure,
10 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
    nor will you let your faithful one see decay.
11 You make known to me the path of life;
    you will fill me with joy in your presence,

            <p>
                              A prayer of David.
                  1 Hear me, Lord, my plea is just;
                      listen to my cry.
                  Hear my prayer—
                      it does not rise from deceitful lips.
                  2 Let my vindication come from you;
                      may your eyes see what is right.

                  3 Though you probe my heart,
                      though you examine me at night and test me,
                  you will find that I have planned no evil;
                      my mouth has not transgressed.
                  4 Though people tried to bribe me,
                      I have kept myself from the ways of the violent
                      through what your lips have commanded.
                  5 My steps have held to your paths;
                      my feet have not stumbled.

                  6 I call on you, my God, for you will answer me;
                      turn your ear to me and hear my prayer.
                  7 Show me the wonders of your great love,
                      you who save by your right hand
                      those who take refuge in you from their foes.
                  8 Keep me as the apple of your eye;
                      hide me in the shadow of your wings
                  9 from the wicked who are out to destroy me,
                      from my mortal enemies who surround me.

                  10 They close up their callous hearts,
                      and their mouths speak with arrogance.
                  11 They have tracked me down, they now surround me,
                      with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.
                  12 They are like a lion hungry for prey,
                      like a fierce lion crouching in cover.

                  13 Rise up, Lord, confront them, bring them down;
                      with your sword rescue me from the wicked.
                  14 By your hand save me from such people, Lord,
                      from those of this world whose reward is in this life.
                  May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies;
                      may their children gorge themselves on it,
                      and may there be leftovers for their little ones.

                  15 As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face;
                      when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.

        PSALM 18</h2>
            <p>
              For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord. He sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
1 I love you, Lord, my strength.

2 The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;
    my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,
    my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

3 I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,
    and I have been saved from my enemies.
4 The cords of death entangled me;
    the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
5 The cords of the grave coiled around me;
    the snares of death confronted me.

6 In my distress I called to the Lord;
    I cried to my God for help.
From his temple he heard my voice;
    my cry came before him, into his ears.
7 The earth trembled and quaked,
    and the foundations of the mountains shook;
    they trembled because he was angry.
8 Smoke rose from his nostrils;
    consuming fire came from his mouth,
    burning coals blazed out of it.
9 He parted the heavens and came down;
    dark clouds were under his feet.
10 He mounted the cherubim and flew;
    he soared on the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—
    the dark rain clouds of the sky.
12 Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,
    with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
13 The Lord thundered from heaven;
    the voice of the Most High resounded.
14 He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,
    with great bolts of lightning he routed them.
15 The valleys of the sea were exposed
    and the foundations of the earth laid bare
at your rebuke, Lord,
    at the blast of breath from your nostrils.

16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
    he drew me out of deep waters.
17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
    from my foes, who were too strong for me.
18 They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
    but the Lord was my support.
19 He brought me out into a spacious place;
    he rescued me because he delighted in me.

20 The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;
    according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord;
    I am not guilty of turning from my God.
22 All his laws are before me;
    I have not turned away from his decrees.
23 I have been blameless before him
    and have kept myself from sin.
24 The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
    according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.

25 To the faithful you show yourself faithful,
    to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
26 to the pure you show yourself pure,
    but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
27 You save the humble
    but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
28 You, Lord, keep my lamp burning;
    my God turns my darkness into light.
29 With your help I can advance against a troop[e];
    with my God I can scale a wall.

30 As for God, his way is perfect:
    The Lord’s word is flawless;
    he shields all who take refuge in him.
31 For who is God besides the Lord?
    And who is the Rock except our God?
32 It is God who arms me with strength
    and keeps my way secure.
33 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;
    he causes me to stand on the heights.
34 He trains my hands for battle;
    my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
35 You make your saving help my shield,
    and your right hand sustains me;
    your help has made me great.
36 You provide a broad path for my feet,
    so that my ankles do not give way.

37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
    I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
38 I crushed them so that they could not rise;
    they fell beneath my feet.
39 You armed me with strength for battle;
    you humbled my adversaries before me.
40 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,
    and I destroyed my foes.
41 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—
    to the Lord, but he did not answer.
42 I beat them as fine as windblown dust;
    I trampled them like mud in the streets.
43 You have delivered me from the attacks of the people;
    you have made me the head of nations.
People I did not know now serve me,
44     foreigners cower before me;
    as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
45 They all lose heart;
    they come trembling from their strongholds.

46 The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!
    Exalted be God my Savior!
47 He is the God who avenges me,
    who subdues nations under me,
48     who saves me from my enemies.
You exalted me above my foes;
    from a violent man you rescued me.
49 Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
    I will sing the praises of your name.

50 He gives his king great victories;
    he shows unfailing love to his anointed,
    to David and to his descendants forever.

      PSALM 19</h2>
              <p>
              For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                1 The heavens declare the glory of God;
                    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
                2 Day after day they pour forth speech;
                    night after night they reveal knowledge.
                3 They have no speech, they use no words;
                    no sound is heard from them.
                4 Yet their voice[b] goes out into all the earth,
                    their words to the ends of the world.
                In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
                5     It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
                    like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
                6 It rises at one end of the heavens
                    and makes its circuit to the other;
                    nothing is deprived of its warmth.

                7 The law of the Lord is perfect,
                    refreshing the soul.
                The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,
                    making wise the simple.
                8 The precepts of the Lord are right,
                    giving joy to the heart.
                The commands of the Lord are radiant,
                    giving light to the eyes.
                9 The fear of the Lord is pure,
                    enduring forever.
                The decrees of the Lord are firm,
                    and all of them are righteous.

                10 They are more precious than gold,
                    than much pure gold;
                they are sweeter than honey,
                    than honey from the honeycomb.
                11 By them your servant is warned;
                    in keeping them there is great reward.
                12 But who can discern their own errors?
                    Forgive my hidden faults.
                13 Keep your servant also from willful sins;
                    may they not rule over me.
                Then I will be blameless,
                    innocent of great transgression.

                14 May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart
                    be pleasing in your sight,
                    Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

                    5 May we shout for joy over your victory
                        and lift up our banners in the name of our God.

                    May the Lord grant all your requests.

                    6 Now this I know:
                        The Lord gives victory to his anointed.
                    He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary
                        with the victorious power of his right hand.
                    7 Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
                        but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
                    8 They are brought to their knees and fall,
                        but we rise up and stand firm.
                    9 Lord, give victory to the king!
                        Answer us when we call!

      PSALM 21</h2>
              <p>
        
          For the director of music. A psalm of David.
                  1 The king rejoices in your strength, Lord.
                      How great is his joy in the victories you give!

                  2 You have granted him his heart’s desire
                      and have not withheld the request of his lips.[b]
                  3 You came to greet him with rich blessings
                      and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
                  4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—
                      length of days, for ever and ever.
                  5 Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;
                      you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
                  6 Surely you have granted him unending blessings
                      and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
                  7 For the king trusts in the Lord;
                      through the unfailing love of the Most High

                  he will not be shaken.

                  8 Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;
                      your right hand will seize your foes.
                  9 When you appear for battle,
                      you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.
                  The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,
                      and his fire will consume them.
                  10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
                      their posterity from mankind.
                  11 Though they plot evil against you
                      and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
                  12 You will make them turn their backs
                      when you aim at them with drawn bow.

                  13 Be exalted in your strength, Lord;
                      we will sing and praise your might.

                                      <p>
                                              For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.
                              1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
                                  Why are you so far from saving me,
                                  so far from my cries of anguish?
                              2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
                                  by night, but I find no rest.[b]

                              3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
                                  you are the one Israel praises.[c]
                              4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
                                  they trusted and you delivered them.
                              5 To you they cried out and were saved;
                                  in you they trusted and were not put to shame.

                              6 But I am a worm and not a man,
                                  scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
                              7 All who see me mock me;
                                  they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
                              8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say,
                                  “let the Lord rescue him.
                              Let him deliver him,
                                  since he delights in him.”

                              9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;
                                  you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
                              10 From birth I was cast on you;
                                  from my mother’s womb you have been my God.

                              11 Do not be far from me,
                                  for trouble is near
                                  and there is no one to help.

                              12 Many bulls surround me;
                                  strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
                              13 Roaring lions that tear their prey
                                  open their mouths wide against me.
                              14 I am poured out like water,
                                  and all my bones are out of joint.
                              My heart has turned to wax;
                                  it has melted within me.
                              15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,
                                  and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;
                                  you lay me in the dust of death.

                              16 Dogs surround me,
                                  a pack of villains encircles me;
                                  they pierce[e] my hands and my feet.
                              17 All my bones are on display;
                                  people stare and gloat over me.
                              18 They divide my clothes among them
                                  and cast lots for my garment.

                              19 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
                                  You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
                              20 Deliver me from the sword,
                                  my precious life from the power of the dogs.
                              21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
                                  save me from the horns of the wild oxen.

                              22 I will declare your name to my people;
                                  in the assembly I will praise you.
                              23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!
                                  All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
                                  Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
                              24 For he has not despised or scorned
                                  the suffering of the afflicted one;
                              he has not hidden his face from him
                                  but has listened to his cry for help.

                              25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
                                  before those who fear you[f] I will fulfill my vows.
                              26 The poor will eat and be satisfied;
                                  those who seek the Lord will praise him—
                                  may your hearts live forever!

                              27 All the ends of the earth
                                  will remember and turn to the Lord,
                              and all the families of the nations
                                  will bow down before him,
                              28 for dominion belongs to the Lord
                                  and he rules over the nations.

                              29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
                                  all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
                                  those who cannot keep themselves alive.
                              30 Posterity will serve him;
                                  future generations will be told about the Lord.
                              31 They will proclaim his righteousness,
                                  declaring to a people yet unborn:
                                  He has done it!

                                    1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
                                    2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,
                                    he leads me beside quiet waters,
                                    3     he refreshes my soul.
                                    He guides me along the right paths
                                        for his name’s sake.

                                    I will fear no evil,
                                        for you are with me;
                                    your rod and your staff,
                                        they comfort me.

                                    5 You prepare a table before me

                                    You anoint my head with oil;
                                        my cup overflows.
                                    6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me

                                        1 The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it,
                                            the world, and all who live in it;

                                            Who may stand in his holy place?
                                        4 The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,
                                            who does not trust in an idol

                                        5 They will receive blessing from the Lord
                                            and vindication from God their Savior.

                                        1 In you, Lord my God,
                                            I put my trust.

                                        2 I trust in you;
                                            do not let me be put to shame,
                                            nor let my enemies triumph over me.
                                        3 No one who hopes in you
                                            will ever be put to shame,
                                        but shame will come on those
                                            who are treacherous without cause.

                                        4 Show me your ways, Lord,
                                            teach me your paths.
                                        5 Guide me in your truth and teach me,
                                            for you are God my Savior,
                                            and my hope is in you all day long.
                                        6 Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love,
                                            for they are from of old.
                                        7 Do not remember the sins of my youth
                                            and my rebellious ways;
                                        according to your love remember me,
                                            for you, Lord, are good.

                                        8 Good and upright is the Lord;
                                            therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
                                        9 He guides the humble in what is right
                                            and teaches them his way.
                                        10 All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful
                                            toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
                                        11 For the sake of your name, Lord,
                                            forgive my iniquity, though it is great.

                                        12 Who, then, are those who fear the Lord?
                                            He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.[b]
                                        13 They will spend their days in prosperity,
                                            and their descendants will inherit the land.
                                        14 The Lord confides in those who fear him;
                                            he makes his covenant known to them.
                                        15 My eyes are ever on the Lord,
                                            for only he will release my feet from the snare.

                                        16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
                                            for I am lonely and afflicted.
                                        17 Relieve the troubles of my heart
                                            and free me from my anguish.
                                        18 Look on my affliction and my distress
                                            and take away all my sins.
                                        19 See how numerous are my enemies
                                            and how fiercely they hate me!

                                        20 Guard my life and rescue me;
                                            do not let me be put to shame,
                                            for I take refuge in you.
                                        21 May integrity and uprightness protect me,
                                            because my hope, Lord,[c] is in you.

                                        22 Deliver Israel, O God,
                                            from all their troubles!                                      </p>

                                        Of David.
                                          1 Vindicate me, Lord,
                                              for I have led a blameless life;
                                          I have trusted in the Lord
                                              and have not faltered.
                                          2 Test me, Lord, and try me,
                                              examine my heart and my mind;
                                          3 for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love
                                              and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.

                                          4 I do not sit with the deceitful,
                                              nor do I associate with hypocrites.
                                          5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers
                                              and refuse to sit with the wicked.
                                          6 I wash my hands in innocence,
                                              and go about your altar, Lord,
                                          7 proclaiming aloud your praise
                                              and telling of all your wonderful deeds.

                                          8 Lord, I love the house where you live,
                                              the place where your glory dwells.
                                          9 Do not take away my soul along with sinners,
                                              my life with those who are bloodthirsty,
                                          10 in whose hands are wicked schemes,
                                              whose right hands are full of bribes.
                                          11 I lead a blameless life;
                                              deliver me and be merciful to me.

                                          12 My feet stand on level ground;
                                              in the great congregation I will praise the Lord.

                                              1 The Lord is my light and my salvation—
                                                  whom shall I fear?
                                              The Lord is the stronghold of my life—
                                                  of whom shall I be afraid?

                                              2 When the wicked advance against me
                                                  to devour[a] me,
                                              it is my enemies and my foes
                                                  who will stumble and fall.
                                              3 Though an army besiege me,
                                                  my heart will not fear;
                                              though war break out against me,
                                                  even then I will be confident.

                                              4 One thing I ask from the Lord,
                                                  this only do I seek:
                                              that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
                                                  all the days of my life,
                                              to gaze on the beauty of the Lord
                                                  and to seek him in his temple.
                                              5 For in the day of trouble
                                                  he will keep me safe in his dwelling;
                                              he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent
                                                  and set me high upon a rock.

                                              6 Then my head will be exalted
                                                  above the enemies who surround me;
                                              at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy;
                                                  I will sing and make music to the Lord.

                                              7 Hear my voice when I call, Lord;
                                                  be merciful to me and answer me.
                                              8 My heart says of you, “Seek his face!”
                                                  Your face, Lord, I will seek.
                                              9 Do not hide your face from me,
                                                  do not turn your servant away in anger;
                                                  you have been my helper.
                                              Do not reject me or forsake me,
                                                  God my Savior.
                                              10 Though my father and mother forsake me,
                                                  the Lord will receive me.
                                              11 Teach me your way, Lord;
                                                  lead me in a straight path
                                                  because of my oppressors.
                                              12 Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes,
                                                  for false witnesses rise up against me,
                                                  spouting malicious accusations.

                                              13 I remain confident of this:
                                                  I will see the goodness of the Lord
                                                  in the land of the living.
                                              14 Wait for the Lord;
                                                  be strong and take heart
                                                  and wait for the Lord.

                                        as I lift up my hands
                                            toward your Most Holy Place.

                                        3 Do not drag me away with the wicked,
                                            with those who do evil,
                                        who speak cordially with their neighbors
                                            but harbor malice in their hearts.
                                        4 Repay them for their deeds
                                            and for their evil work;
                                        repay them for what their hands have done
                                            and bring back on them what they deserve.

                                        5 Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord
                                            and what his hands have done,
                                        he will tear them down
                                            and never build them up again.

                                        6 Praise be to the Lord,
                                            for he has heard my cry for mercy.
                                        7 The Lord is my strength and my shield;
                                            my heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
                                        My heart leaps for joy,
                                            and with my song I praise him.

                                        8 The Lord is the strength of his people,
                                            a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
                                        9 Save your people and bless your inheritance;
                                            be their shepherd and carry them forever.

                                       A psalm of David.
                                            1 Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings,
                                                ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
                                            2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
                                                worship the Lord in the splendor of his[a] holiness.

                                            3 The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
                                                the God of glory thunders,
                                                the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
                                            4 The voice of the Lord is powerful;
                                                the voice of the Lord is majestic.
                                            5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
                                                the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
                                            6 He makes Lebanon leap like a calf,
                                                Sirion[b] like a young wild ox.
                                            7 The voice of the Lord strikes
                                                with flashes of lightning.
                                            8 The voice of the Lord shakes the desert;
                                                the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
                                            9 The voice of the Lord twists the oaks[c]
                                                and strips the forests bare.
                                            And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”

                                            10 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
                                                the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
                                            11 The Lord gives strength to his people;
                                                the Lord blesses his people with peace

                                       A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple.[b] Of David.
                                            1 I will exalt you, Lord,
                                                for you lifted me out of the depths
                                                and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
                                            2 Lord my God, I called to you for help,
                                                and you healed me.
                                            3 You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead;
                                                you spared me from going down to the pit.

                                            4 Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people;
                                                praise his holy name.
                                            5 For his anger lasts only a moment,
                                                but his favor lasts a lifetime;
                                            weeping may stay for the night,
                                                but rejoicing comes in the morning.

                                            6 When I felt secure, I said,
                                                “I will never be shaken.”
                                            7 Lord, when you favored me,
                                                you made my royal mountain[c] stand firm;
                                            but when you hid your face,
                                                I was dismayed.

                                            8 To you, Lord, I called;
                                                to the Lord I cried for mercy:
                                            9 “What is gained if I am silenced,
                                                if I go down to the pit?
                                            Will the dust praise you?
                                                Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
                                            10 Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me;
                                                Lord, be my help.”

                                            11 You turned my wailing into dancing;
                                                you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
                                            12 that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.
                                                Lord my God, I will praise you forever.

                                          1 In you, Lord, I have taken refuge;
                                              let me never be put to shame;
                                              deliver me in your righteousness.
                                          2 Turn your ear to me,
                                              come quickly to my rescue;
                                          be my rock of refuge,
                                              a strong fortress to save me.
                                          3 Since you are my rock and my fortress,
                                              for the sake of your name lead and guide me.
                                          4 Keep me free from the trap that is set for me,
                                              for you are my refuge.
                                          5 Into your hands I commit my spirit;
                                              deliver me, Lord, my faithful God.

                                          6 I hate those who cling to worthless idols;
                                              as for me, I trust in the Lord.
                                          7 I will be glad and rejoice in your love,
                                              for you saw my affliction
                                              and knew the anguish of my soul.
                                          8 You have not given me into the hands of the enemy
                                              but have set my feet in a spacious place.

                                          9 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am in distress;
                                              my eyes grow weak with sorrow,
                                              my soul and body with grief.
                                          10 My life is consumed by anguish
                                              and my years by groaning;
                                          my strength fails because of my affliction,[b]
                                              and my bones grow weak.
                                          11 Because of all my enemies,
                                              I am the utter contempt of my neighbors
                                          and an object of dread to my closest friends—
                                              those who see me on the street flee from me.
                                          12 I am forgotten as though I were dead;
                                              I have become like broken pottery.
                                          13 For I hear many whispering,
                                              “Terror on every side!”
                                          They conspire against me
                                              and plot to take my life.

                                          14 But I trust in you, Lord;
                                              I say, “You are my God.”
                                          15 My times are in your hands;
                                              deliver me from the hands of my enemies,
                                              from those who pursue me.
                                          16 Let your face shine on your servant;
                                              save me in your unfailing love.
                                          17 Let me not be put to shame, Lord,
                                              for I have cried out to you;
                                          but let the wicked be put to shame
                                              and be silent in the realm of the dead.
                                          18 Let their lying lips be silenced,
                                              for with pride and contempt
                                              they speak arrogantly against the righteous.

                                          19 How abundant are the good things
                                              that you have stored up for those who fear you,
                                          that you bestow in the sight of all,
                                              on those who take refuge in you.
                                          20 In the shelter of your presence you hide them
                                              from all human intrigues;
                                          you keep them safe in your dwelling
                                              from accusing tongues.

                                          21 Praise be to the Lord,
                                              for he showed me the wonders of his love
                                              when I was in a city under siege.
                                          22 In my alarm I said,
                                              “I am cut off from your sight!”
                                          Yet you heard my cry for mercy
                                              when I called to you for help.

                                          23 Love the Lord, all his faithful people!
                                              The Lord preserves those who are true to him,
                                              but the proud he pays back in full.
                                          24 Be strong and take heart,
                                              all you who hope in the Lord.

                                       Of David. A maskil.[a]
                                        1 Blessed is the one
                                            whose transgressions are forgiven,
                                            whose sins are covered.
                                        2 Blessed is the one
                                            whose sin the Lord does not count against them
                                            and in whose spirit is no deceit.

                                        3 When I kept silent,
                                            my bones wasted away
                                            through my groaning all day long.
                                        4 For day and night
                                            your hand was heavy on me;
                                        my strength was sapped
                                            as in the heat of summer.[b]

                                        5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you
                                            and did not cover up my iniquity.
                                        I said, “I will confess
                                            my transgressions to the Lord.”
                                        And you forgave
                                            the guilt of my sin.

                                        6 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you
                                            while you may be found;
                                        surely the rising of the mighty waters
                                            will not reach them.
                                        7 You are my hiding place;
                                            you will protect me from trouble
                                            and surround me with songs of deliverance.

                                        8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
                                            I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
                                        9 Do not be like the horse or the mule,
                                            which have no understanding
                                        but must be controlled by bit and bridle
                                            or they will not come to you.
                                        10 Many are the woes of the wicked,
                                            but the Lord’s unfailing love
                                            surrounds the one who trusts in him.

                                        11 Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;
                                            sing, all you who are upright in heart!

                                              1 Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous;
                                                it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
                                            2 Praise the Lord with the harp;
                                                make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
                                            3 Sing to him a new song;
                                                play skillfully, and shout for joy.

                                            4 For the word of the Lord is right and true;
                                                he is faithful in all he does.
                                            5 The Lord loves righteousness and justice;
                                                the earth is full of his unfailing love.

                                            6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
                                                their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
                                            7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars[a];
                                                he puts the deep into storehouses.
                                            8 Let all the earth fear the Lord;
                                                let all the people of the world revere him.
                                            9 For he spoke, and it came to be;
                                                he commanded, and it stood firm.

                                            10 The Lord foils the plans of the nations;
                                                he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
                                            11 But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever,
                                                the purposes of his heart through all generations.

                                            12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,
                                                the people he chose for his inheritance.
                                            13 From heaven the Lord looks down
                                                and sees all mankind;
                                            14 from his dwelling place he watches
                                                all who live on earth—
                                            15 he who forms the hearts of all,
                                                who considers everything they do.

                                            16 No king is saved by the size of his army;
                                                no warrior escapes by his great strength.
                                            17 A horse is a vain hope for deliverance;
                                                despite all its great strength it cannot save.
                                            18 But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him,
                                                on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,
                                            19 to deliver them from death
                                                and keep them alive in famine.

                                            20 We wait in hope for the Lord;
                                                he is our help and our shield.
                                            21 In him our hearts rejoice,
                                                for we trust in his holy name.
                                            22 May your unfailing love be with us, Lord,
                                                even as we put our hope in you.

                                              1 I will extol the Lord at all times;
                                                  his praise will always be on my lips.

                                                  let us exalt his name together.

                                              4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
                                                  he delivered me from all my fears.

                                              6 This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;
                                                  he saved him out of all his troubles.

                                                  blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.

                                                  to blot out their name from the earth.

                                                  he delivers them from all their troubles.
                                              18 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
                                                  and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

                                              19 The righteous person may have many troubles,
                                                  but the Lord delivers him from them all;
                                              20 he protects all his bones,
                                                  not one of them will be broken.

                                              21 Evil will slay the wicked;
                                                  the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
                                              22 The Lord will rescue his servants;
                                                  no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.

                                          1 Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me;
                                              fight against those who fight against me.
                                          2 Take up shield and armor;
                                              arise and come to my aid.
                                          3 Brandish spear and javelin[a]
                                              against those who pursue me.
                                          Say to me,
                                              “I am your salvation.”

                                          4 May those who seek my life
                                              be disgraced and put to shame;
                                          may those who plot my ruin
                                              be turned back in dismay.
                                          5 May they be like chaff before the wind,
                                              with the angel of the Lord driving them away;
                                          6 may their path be dark and slippery,
                                              with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.

                                          7 Since they hid their net for me without cause
                                              and without cause dug a pit for me,
                                          8 may ruin overtake them by surprise—
                                              may the net they hid entangle them,
                                              may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
                                          9 Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord
                                              and delight in his salvation.
                                          10 My whole being will exclaim,
                                              “Who is like you, Lord?
                                          You rescue the poor from those too strong for them,
                                              the poor and needy from those who rob them.”

                                          11 Ruthless witnesses come forward;
                                              they question me on things I know nothing about.
                                          12 They repay me evil for good
                                              and leave me like one bereaved.
                                          13 Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth
                                              and humbled myself with fasting.
                                          When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
                                          14     I went about mourning
                                              as though for my friend or brother.
                                          I bowed my head in grief
                                              as though weeping for my mother.
                                          15 But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee;
                                              assailants gathered against me without my knowledge.
                                              They slandered me without ceasing.
                                          16 Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;[b]
                                              they gnashed their teeth at me.

                                          17 How long, Lord, will you look on?
                                              Rescue me from their ravages,
                                              my precious life from these lions.
                                          18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly;
                                              among the throngs I will praise you.
                                          19 Do not let those gloat over me
                                              who are my enemies without cause;
                                          do not let those who hate me without reason
                                              maliciously wink the eye.
                                          20 They do not speak peaceably,
                                              but devise false accusations
                                              against those who live quietly in the land.
                                          21 They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha!
                                              With our own eyes we have seen it.”

                                          22 Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent.
                                              Do not be far from me, Lord.
                                          23 Awake, and rise to my defense!
                                              Contend for me, my God and Lord.
                                          24 Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God;
                                              do not let them gloat over me.
                                          25 Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!”
                                              or say, “We have swallowed him up.”

                                          26 May all who gloat over my distress
                                              be put to shame and confusion;
                                          may all who exalt themselves over me
                                              be clothed with shame and disgrace.
                                          27 May those who delight in my vindication
                                              shout for joy and gladness;
                                          may they always say, “The Lord be exalted,
                                              who delights in the well-being of his servant.”

                                          28 My tongue will proclaim your righteousness,
                                              your praises all day long.

                                       For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.
                                            1 I have a message from God in my heart
                                                concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:[b]
                                            There is no fear of God
                                                before their eyes.

                                            2 In their own eyes they flatter themselves
                                                too much to detect or hate their sin.
                                            3 The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful;
                                                they fail to act wisely or do good.
                                            4 Even on their beds they plot evil;
                                                they commit themselves to a sinful course
                                                and do not reject what is wrong.

                                            5 Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens,
                                                your faithfulness to the skies.
                                            6 Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
                                                your justice like the great deep.
                                                You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.
                                            7 How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
                                                People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
                                            8 They feast on the abundance of your house;
                                                you give them drink from your river of delights.
                                            9 For with you is the fountain of life;
                                                in your light we see light.

                                            10 Continue your love to those who know you,
                                                your righteousness to the upright in heart.
                                            11 May the foot of the proud not come against me,
                                                nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
                                            12 See how the evildoers lie fallen—
                                                thrown down, not able to rise!

                                       Of David.
                                            1 Do not fret because of those who are evil
                                                or be envious of those who do wrong;
                                            2 for like the grass they will soon wither,
                                                like green plants they will soon die away.

                                            3 Trust in the Lord and do good;
                                                dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
                                            4 Take delight in the Lord,
                                                and he will give you the desires of your heart.

                                            5 Commit your way to the Lord;
                                                trust in him and he will do this:
                                            6 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,
                                                your vindication like the noonday sun.

                                            7 Be still before the Lord
                                                and wait patiently for him;
                                            do not fret when people succeed in their ways,
                                                when they carry out their wicked schemes.

                                            8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;
                                                do not fret—it leads only to evil.
                                            9 For those who are evil will be destroyed,
                                                but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.

                                            10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more;
                                                though you look for them, they will not be found.
                                            11 But the meek will inherit the land
                                                and enjoy peace and prosperity.

                                            12 The wicked plot against the righteous
                                                and gnash their teeth at them;
                                            13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
                                                for he knows their day is coming.

                                            14 The wicked draw the sword
                                                and bend the bow
                                            to bring down the poor and needy,
                                                to slay those whose ways are upright.
                                            15 But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
                                                and their bows will be broken.

                                            16 Better the little that the righteous have
                                                than the wealth of many wicked;
                                            17 for the power of the wicked will be broken,
                                                but the Lord upholds the righteous.

                                            18 The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care,
                                                and their inheritance will endure forever.
                                            19 In times of disaster they will not wither;
                                                in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.

                                            20 But the wicked will perish:
                                                Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field,
                                                they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.

                                            21 The wicked borrow and do not repay,
                                                but the righteous give generously;
                                            22 those the Lord blesses will inherit the land,
                                                but those he curses will be destroyed.

                                            23 The Lord makes firm the steps
                                                of the one who delights in him;
                                            24 though he may stumble, he will not fall,
                                                for the Lord upholds him with his hand.

                                            25 I was young and now I am old,
                                                yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken
                                                or their children begging bread.
                                            26 They are always generous and lend freely;
                                                their children will be a blessing.[b]

                                            27 Turn from evil and do good;
                                                then you will dwell in the land forever.
                                            28 For the Lord loves the just
                                                and will not forsake his faithful ones.

                                            Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed[c];
                                                the offspring of the wicked will perish.
                                            29 The righteous will inherit the land
                                                and dwell in it forever.

                                            30 The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,
                                                and their tongues speak what is just.
                                            31 The law of their God is in their hearts;
                                                their feet do not slip.

                                            32 The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
                                                intent on putting them to death;
                                            33 but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked
                                                or let them be condemned when brought to trial.

                                            34 Hope in the Lord
                                                and keep his way.
                                            He will exalt you to inherit the land;
                                                when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.

                                            35 I have seen a wicked and ruthless man
                                                flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
                                            36 but he soon passed away and was no more;
                                                though I looked for him, he could not be found.

                                            37 Consider the blameless, observe the upright;
                                                a future awaits those who seek peace.[d]
                                            38 But all sinners will be destroyed;
                                                there will be no future[e] for the wicked.

                                            39 The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord;
                                                he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
                                            40 The Lord helps them and delivers them;
                                                he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,
                                                because they take refuge in him.

                                      <p>
                                       A psalm of David. A petition.
                                          1 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger
                                              or discipline me in your wrath.
                                          2 Your arrows have pierced me,
                                              and your hand has come down on me.
                                          3 Because of your wrath there is no health in my body;
                                              there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
                                          4 My guilt has overwhelmed me
                                              like a burden too heavy to bear.

                                          5 My wounds fester and are loathsome
                                              because of my sinful folly.
                                          6 I am bowed down and brought very low;
                                              all day long I go about mourning.
                                          7 My back is filled with searing pain;
                                              there is no health in my body.
                                          8 I am feeble and utterly crushed;
                                              I groan in anguish of heart.

                                          9 All my longings lie open before you, Lord;
                                              my sighing is not hidden from you.
                                          10 My heart pounds, my strength fails me;
                                              even the light has gone from my eyes.
                                          11 My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds;
                                              my neighbors stay far away.
                                          12 Those who want to kill me set their traps,
                                              those who would harm me talk of my ruin;
                                              all day long they scheme and lie.

                                          13 I am like the deaf, who cannot hear,
                                              like the mute, who cannot speak;
                                          14 I have become like one who does not hear,
                                              whose mouth can offer no reply.
                                          15 Lord, I wait for you;
                                              you will answer, Lord my God.
                                          16 For I said, “Do not let them gloat
                                              or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”

                                          17 For I am about to fall,
                                              and my pain is ever with me.
                                          18 I confess my iniquity;
                                              I am troubled by my sin.
                                          19 Many have become my enemies without cause[b];
                                              those who hate me without reason are numerous.
                                          20 Those who repay my good with evil
                                              lodge accusations against me,
                                              though I seek only to do what is good.

                                          21 Lord, do not forsake me;
                                              do not be far from me, my God.
                                          22 Come quickly to help me,
                                              my Lord and my Savior.

                                       For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
                                            1 I said, “I will watch my ways
                                                and keep my tongue from sin;
                                            I will put a muzzle on my mouth
                                                while in the presence of the wicked.”
                                            2 So I remained utterly silent,
                                                not even saying anything good.
                                            But my anguish increased;
                                            3     my heart grew hot within me.
                                            While I meditated, the fire burned;
                                                then I spoke with my tongue:

                                            4 “Show me, Lord, my life’s end
                                                and the number of my days;
                                                let me know how fleeting my life is.
                                            5 You have made my days a mere handbreadth;
                                                the span of my years is as nothing before you.
                                            Everyone is but a breath,
                                                even those who seem secure.[b]

                                            6 “Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom;
                                                in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth
                                                without knowing whose it will finally be.

                                            7 “But now, Lord, what do I look for?
                                                My hope is in you.
                                            8 Save me from all my transgressions;
                                                do not make me the scorn of fools.
                                            9 I was silent; I would not open my mouth,
                                                for you are the one who has done this.
                                            10 Remove your scourge from me;
                                                I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
                                            11 When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,
                                                you consume their wealth like a moth—
                                                surely everyone is but a breath.

                                            12 “Hear my prayer, Lord,
                                                listen to my cry for help;
                                                do not be deaf to my weeping.
                                            I dwell with you as a foreigner,
                                                a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
                                            13 Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again
                                                before I depart and am no more.”

                                      <p>
                                            For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.
                                            1 I waited patiently for the Lord;
                                                he turned to me and heard my cry.
                                            2 He lifted me out of the slimy pit,
                                                out of the mud and mire;
                                            he set my feet on a rock
                                                and gave me a firm place to stand.
                                            3 He put a new song in my mouth,
                                                a hymn of praise to our God.
                                            Many will see and fear the Lord
                                                and put their trust in him.

                                            4 Blessed is the one
                                                who trusts in the Lord,
                                            who does not look to the proud,
                                                to those who turn aside to false gods.[b]
                                            5 Many, Lord my God,
                                                are the wonders you have done,
                                                the things you planned for us.
                                            None can compare with you;
                                                were I to speak and tell of your deeds,
                                                they would be too many to declare.

                                            6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire—
                                                but my ears you have opened[c]—
                                                burnt offerings and sin offerings[d] you did not require.
                                            7 Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—
                                                it is written about me in the scroll.[e]
                                            8 I desire to do your will, my God;
                                                your law is within my heart.”

                                            9 I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly;
                                                I do not seal my lips, Lord,
                                                as you know.
                                            10 I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;
                                                I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help.
                                            I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness
                                                from the great assembly.

                                            11 Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord;
                                                may your love and faithfulness always protect me.
                                            12 For troubles without number surround me;
                                                my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.
                                            They are more than the hairs of my head,
                                                and my heart fails within me.
                                            13 Be pleased to save me, Lord;
                                                come quickly, Lord, to help me.

                                            14 May all who want to take my life
                                                be put to shame and confusion;
                                            may all who desire my ruin
                                                be turned back in disgrace.
                                            15 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
                                                be appalled at their own shame.
                                            16 But may all who seek you
                                                rejoice and be glad in you;
                                            may those who long for your saving help always say,
                                                “The Lord is great!”

                                            17 But as for me, I am poor and needy;
                                                may the Lord think of me.
                                            You are my help and my deliverer;
                                                you are my God, do not delay.
                                      </p>
